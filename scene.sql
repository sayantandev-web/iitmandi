DExtER team is currently working on permafrost mapping, permafrost degradation, landslide susceptibility mapping, forest fires, vegetation studies and environment related problems of the Himalayan region that could be analysed with Remote Sensing. Many of these problems are related to climate change and global warming, so how can we use remote sensing to assess the susceptibility, risk and vulnerability of these issues are the main focus of his research group. We do lots of field works in the rugged terrain of the Himalayas and have mapped those probable permafrost areas, landslide susceptible areas using Machine learning algorithms and in near future they want to calibrate these models with the field data. We shall also be studying the effect of climate change on prmafrost degradation, enhanced occurences of landslides and slope instability problems in future, so we are also looking at the potential areas where such events may happen. In that way we could be better prepared to handle and cope up with these issues.</p>\r\n', '', '2', '', '', '1699003116157319.JPG', 'https://www.dexterlab.co.in/', '1', '1');

This will enable her to work with A/Professor Ha H. Bui at the Monash Computational Geomechanics (MCG) Lab, Department of Civil Engineering, Monash University, Australia. The SIRE fellowship is for a duration of 6 months on a topic titled &ldquo;Development of a novel simulation tool for modeling debris flow phenomena and its application to study debris flows of Western Himalaya&rdquo;. The proposed study envisions to develop a simulation tool for numerical modeling of debris flow in order to obtain important flow and depositional parameters like flow height, front velocities, impact pressure and its distribution, extent of run-out zone and amount of material deposition. Such predictions are imperative for risk assessment associated with debris flow phenomena and to design the defensive structures as countermeasures for reducing related devastations and hazards. The proposed numerical framework pivots around a mesh-free type Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) approach in conjunction with application of a rate-dependent constitutive model, newly proposed by Dr. Mukherjee, which can mimic the behavior of fast flowing debris material. Along with the development and validation of the numerical tool, the proposed study also aims to simulate one of the major debris flows that took place in the Western (Garhwal) Himalaya, i.e. Kedarnath debris flow of 2013. The successful outcome of the project would aid in assessing and predicting debris flows in the mountainous terrains along the Himalayan belt.</span></span></span></span></span></p><br />\r\n<br

However, climate change coupled with anthropogenic forcing has posed severe challenges in the long-term sustainability of these FES in the region. Himalayas are prone to multiple natural disasters, most severe of which are water-related disasters like cloudbursts, flash floods, landslides, etc. The simultaneous occurrence of two or more natural extremes (i.e., compound extremes) has a more significant impact on natural-human systems than individual extremes. Yet, we lack a comprehensive understanding of the significance and magnitude of the impacts of compound extremes in this region. The proposed project will integrate research on FES availability under long-term monsoon variability and water-related hazards in Himalayan regions (four catchments in three countries). The vulnerability and resilience of the freshwater ecosystem to the compound extreme will be analysed for informed decision-making to ensure the long-term sustainability of freshwater ecosystems.

Lateral strength of URM buildings can be assessed using experimental studies or numerical simulation, but conducting such studies on full-scale building specimens is expensive and requires huge computational effort and input data, which is not easily available. Therefore, the availability of test results and data is scarce in many developing countries having a huge concentration of URM buildings. Moreover, the quality and strength of masonry found in these countries are inferior to those found in some developed countries where data are available. This results in under-developed design codes and thus improper design and construction of URM buildings in seismically active regions of many developing countries. Therefore, simple analytical methods are required to be developed for the estimation of lateral load-carrying capacity of URM buildings with the help of systematic experimental and numerical studies on full-scale specimens. The paper presents a comparative assessment of the lateral strength of a URM building using experimental, analytical and numerical approaches. Pseudo-static in-plane cyclic tests were carried out over three full-scale URM walls with different opening configurations followed by testing of a single story URM building having a single room, constituting the walls, which were already tested. The walls and a building were then numerically analyzed in Abaqus and Strand7 to estimate the lateral load-carrying capacity. The lateral strength of individual walls was also estimated analytically using several existing methods. Finally, the effectiveness of combining the lateral strength of individual walls to estimate the lateral strength of full URM building was assessed that can be handy to the practicing engineers.</p>\n', '', 'On My Page', '1', '1'),

In view of the ongoing environmental and climate changes in the Northeastern of India, regionalization of homogeneous rainfall region is essential to lay out an effective flood frequency analysis of this region. The choice of appropriate cluster approach used according to the data of the basin is also significant. In the context of this study, total precipitation data of stations operated by Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) in Northeastern of India basins for cluster analysis are used. Further, five cluster validity indices, namely Partition Coefficient, Partition Entropy, Extended Xie-Beni index, Fukuyama-Sugeno index and Kwon index have been tested to determine the effectiveness in identifying optimal partition provided by the fuzzy c mean clustering algorithm (FCM). A comparison is also performed using K- Mean clustering algorithm. Additionally, regional homogeneity tests based on L-moments approach are used to check homogeneity of regions identified by both cluster analysis approaches. It was concluded that regional homogeneity test results show that regions defined by FCM method are sufficiently homogeneous for regional frequency analysis.</p>\n', '', 'On My Page', '1', '1'),

Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), Standardized effective Precipitation Evapo-Transpiration Index (SP*ETI) and Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) at the timescale of 12-months have been used for drought characterization. The K-means clustering algorithm has been utilized to delineate distinct drought homogeneous regions in India. Trends and periodicities in drought characteristics have also been analysed. The results of this study reveal that increase in evapotranspiration due to projected rise in temperature would play a major role in affecting future drought dynamics in most parts of India. Analysis indicates that computed magnitude of drought intensity, duration and frequency depends on the choice of drought indicator. SPEI drought index has been found to project highest drought risk as compared to other two indices used in this study. North India is more vulnerable to increase in drought severity and frequency in near future. However in far future, most parts of the country, except few southeastern states, are likely to face an escalation in drought severity and frequency. A shift in drought hazard from central India toward southeast-central India is likely to happen with increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) concentration. The areal extent of droughts has been found to be increasing historically which is expected to increase further in future for most parts of the country. Historically, drought dynamics were more influenced by decrease in precipitation. However, in future, the drought dynamics will be significantly influenced by increased evapotranspiration resulting from increase in temperature in spite of likely increase in precipitation. The periodicity analysis indicates inter-annual periodicities influencing monsoon months to be distributed uniformly across all clusters of the Indian subcontinent with dominant cycles of 2&ndash;3.6 years. Further, change in periodic cycles of drought due to climate change is found to be insignificant.</p>\n', '', 'On My Page', '1', '2'),

Analysis led to identification of major dry periods from the evaluated drought characteristics and generation of spatial maps of magnitude, duration and intensity for each index for each of the dry periods. The socioeconomic aspects of drought have also been explored by analyzing drought hazard, vulnerability and risk which are mapped spatially to evaluate drought susceptibility of various regions in the basin. The study revealed a positive correlation between the maximum drought magnitude, drought duration and drought risk, and an indirect proportionality between drought intensities and drought frequency. The analysis of physical drought characteristics revealed that the RDI deviated significantly from the remainder indices. The importance of socioeconomic variables is also highlighted as districts having normal meteorological conditions became the hotspots of drought risk because of sensitive demographics in the study basin.</p>\n', '', 'On My Page', '1', '1'),

The overall analysis results showed that all satellite-based datasets have significant spatial heterogeneity in estimating precipitation extremes accurately which varies across India. Among all satellite-precipitation datasets, TRMM found closer to IMD than SM2RAIN-ASCAT and CHIRPS. The frequency based SEPIs showed that CHIRPS, TRMM and SM2RAIN-ASCAT have similarities to IMD precipitations.

Thus, it is important to study the effect of unequal slab levels, in adjacent buildings, on the seismic pounding. In this study, two adjacent reinforced concrete (RC) frames, 2-story and 4-story with three different slab levels are considered. Finite element modelling of these RC frames is done in ABAQUSv2021.

Several small towns in the Indian Himalayan region are rapidly expanding their building infrastructure to meet the demand of ever increasing population and tourists. An extensive survey of the existing buildings in Mandi, which is one of the populous towns of the Himachal Pradesh state in northern India, is carried out to assess the seismic vulnerability of buildings. A total of 573 RC buildings were assessed using existing pre-earthquake RVS guidelines, and critical attributes that are known to be associated with the performance of the buildings under earthquake shaking were noted. It was noticed that there is an inconsistency in counting the number of stories in the hilly buildings when different RVS methods are employed. Therefore, a numerical study is also performed to establish guidelines for counting the number of stories in hilly buildings for their RVS. Further, based on the vulnerable attributes in the buildings of hilly region, an improved RVS method is proposed.

Force-controlled nonlinear static analyses are carried out to probabilistically assess the critical blast location for bare- and infill-framed buildings. It is observed that the blast on the downhill side is critical for the hillside buildings having a story ratio of 0.5; whereas, the blast on the uphill side is more damaging for the buildings with a story ratio of 1 and 2. The blast fragility curves, developed herein, show that the presence of infills significantly affects the blast response of RC hillside buildings and the location of the peak response. Further, critical scaled distances corresponding to various damage states for the hillside buildings are found to be more than that for the regular buildings. Furthermore, the response of hillside buildings was investigated under blast-induced ground motions to evaluate the key engineering demand parameters pertinent to structural and non-structural damages.</span></span></span></span></p>\n', '<p>Blast-induced ground motions; Blast fragility; Blast response; Critical scaled distance; Hillside building; Multiplehazards; Uncoupled approach.</p>\n', 'On My Page', '1', '2');

Open stories are provided at different levels in a building according to the prospective location of the approach road level. These buildings are subjected to bi-directional earthquake excitation, and non-linear dynamic analyses are performed under a suite of 22 ground motion records. Dynamic characteristics and seismic responses such as peak inter-story drift ratio, peak floor acceleration, peak roof displacement, and maximum story shear of the buildings are investigated. A probabilistic performance assessment of these buildings with different probable locations of the open story is presented. In general, the probabilistic assessment reveals that the presence of the open story significantly reduces the seismic performance of these buildings.

Herein, two different geometries (broad and slender)of fixed base and base isolated ground supported tank s are analyzed, and corresponding seismic fragility curves are developed for different base conditions (without and with soil&ndash;structure interaction, considering different soil types).The study shows that the soil&ndash;structure interaction significantly affects the seismic performance of fixed base and base isolated tanks, and in certain cases, neglecting its effect can underestimate the seismic fragility of ground supported tank. Further, the tank structure provided with base isolation system may not follow the trend of response shown by the system without isolation under different soil conditions. The general perception of response reduction with smaller soil stiffness, in order to neglect the soil&ndash;structure interaction effect s, may not always hold good.

In this paper, multistory base-isolated buildings are investigated under the independent multihazard scenario of earthquake and blast-induced ground motion (BIGM). Multistory building models equipped with five different types of isolation systems, namely, the laminated rubber bearing (LRB), lead-rubber bearing (N-Z system), pure friction (PF) system, friction pendulum system (FPS), and resilient-friction base isolator (R-FBI) are assessed under bidirectional multihazard excitations. The suitability of the isolation systems and their key parameters in protecting multistory buildings is evaluated. Furthermore, the influence of the superstructure characteristics, such as the superstructure damping and the number of stories, is also assessed. The effect of bidirectional hazards on fixed-base buildings is also presented for comparison. The key response quantities of base-isolated buildings are presented and compared for different isolation systems. Parametric investigations are also conducted, and the trends of the response quantities are presented to study the influence of important parameters of isolation systems in protecting the buildings under the multihazard scenario of earthquake and BIGM. The results of the investigation show that the behaviors of the buildings equipped with various isolation systems are different for the two hazards. Moreover, the influences of the key parameters of the isolation systems are found to be different for various hazards. Therefore, the selection of design parameters of isolation systems shall be made with due consideration of the influence of multiple hazards. Additionally, the influence of the properties of the superstructure, such as the number of stories and the damping of the superstructure, on the behavior of the base-isolated buildings under the multihazard loading, is presented.</span></span></p>\n', '<p><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif\">Multihazard; Base Isolation;&nbsp;Dynamic Excitation; Blast-induced ground motion</span></span></p>\n', 'On My Page', '1', '2'),

We have also analysed the extreme behaviour of precipitation (in both upper and lower tails) using quantile-quantile (Q&ndash;Q) regression analysis after selecting 33 random precipitation grids across India. The overall analysis results showed that all satellite-based datasets have significant spatial heterogeneity in estimating precipitation extremes accurately which varies across India. Among all satellite-precipitation datasets, TRMM found closer to IMD than SM2RAIN-ASCAT and CHIRPS. The frequency based SEPIs showed that CHIRPS, TRMM and SM2RAIN-ASCAT have similarities to IMD precipitations. The intensity-based SEPIs show that TRMM and CHIRPS have significant similarities with IMD precipitations. The wet season-based analysis results showed that TRMM and CHIRPS are closer to IMD precipitations than SM2RAIN-ASCAT satellite-precipitations. Overall TRMM and CHIRPS datasets performed well across most regions in India, while SM2RAIN-ASCAT dataset has performed poorly in India, especially for extreme precipitation cases.

This study presents a spatiotemporal analysis of drought occurrence, frequency, and hazard. Meteorological data from a selected regional climate model for representative concentration pathways (RCP 8.5) was used to compute the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) at a 12-month scale to characterize drought in different regions of India. An improved methodology was then developed to improve the current framework used for the development of severity&ndash;duration&ndash;frequency (SDF) curves. The improved methodology for developing SDF curves is copula based and uses Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation for parameter estimation under the Bayesian framework. Moreover, an improved fuzzy clustering-based drought hazard assessment measure, known as the Modified Drought Hazard Index (MDHI), is also presented. It was found that drought frequency is increasing with time for all the regions of India except for Region 2, i.e.,&nbsp;Western Ghats. Further, a significant increase in potential evapotranspiration would cause a prolonged dryness in most of the regions during the twenty-first century. With the progression of time, drought severity associated with various durations is expected to significantly increase with the increase in duration for most of the regions.

The buildings are idealized as single degree of freedom (SDOF) system and multi-degrees of freedom (MDOF) system with one lateral degree of freedom at each floor level. The isolation system is modeled using two different mathematical models such as: (i) code-recommended equivalent linear elastic-viscous damping model and (ii) bi-linear hysteretic model. The uncertain parameters of the isolator considered are time period, damping ratio, and yield displacement. Moreover, the amplitude and frequency of the sinusoidal base excitation function are considered uncertain. The uncertainty propagation is investigated using generalized polynomial chaos (gPC) expansion technique. The unknown gPC expansion coefficients are obtained by non-intrusive sparse grid collocation scheme. Efficiency of the technique is compared with the sampling method of Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. The stochastic response quantities of interest considered are bearing displacement and top floor acceleration of the building. Effects of individual uncertain parameters on the building response are quantified using sensitivity analyses. Effect of various uncertainty levels of the input parameters on the dynamic response of the building is also investigated. The peak bearing displacement and top floor acceleration are more influenced by the amplitude and frequency of the sinusoidal base excitation function. The effective time period of the isolation system also produces a considerable influence. However, in the presence of similar uncertainty level in the time period, amplitude and frequency of the sinusoidal forcing function, the effect of uncertainties in the other parameters of the isolator (e.g., damping ratio and yield displacement) is comparatively less. Interestingly, the mean values of the response quantities are found to be higher than the deterministic values in several instances, indicating the need of conducting stochastic analysis.

This study aims to develop contribution functions for common types of cladding used in different types of buildings considering damage repair costs. In the first part of this study, a building survey was performed to identify types and quantity of cladding used in residential, commercial and industrial buildings in Christchurch, New Zealand; where it was found that the most common cladding types are glazing, masonry veneer, monolithic cladding and precast panels. The data collected during the survey was also used to develop cladding distribution (i.e. density) functions. The second step involved identifying fragility functions from relevant literature which are applicable to the cladding detailing used in New Zealand. The third step involved surveying consultants, suppliers and builders on typical repair/replacement cost.

Moreover, minimizing their damage is also of vital significance to the uninterrupted functionality of a building. For efficient decision making, it is important to be able to estimate the cost and downtime associated with the repair of the damage likely to be caused at different hazard levels used in seismic design. Generalized loss functions for two important NSCs commonly used in New Zealand, namely suspended ceilings and drywall partitions are developed in this study. The methodology to develop the loss functions, in the form of engineering demand parameter vs. expected loss due to the considered components, is based on the existing framework for the storey level loss estimation. Nevertheless, exhaustive construction/field data are employed to make these loss functions more generic. In order to estimate financial losses resulting from the failure of suspended ceilings, generalized ceiling fragility functions are developed and combined with the cost functions, which give the loss associated with typical ceilings at various peak acceleration demands. Similarly, probabilities of different damage states in drywall partitions are combined with their associated repair/replacement costs to find the cumulative distribution of the expected loss due to partitions at various drift levels, which is then normalized in terms of the total building cost. Efficiencies of the developed loss functions are investigated through detailed loss assessment of case study reinforced concrete (RC) buildings. It is observed that the difference between the expected losses for ceilings, predicted by the developed generic loss function, and the losses obtained from the detailed loss estimation method is within 5%. Similarly, the developed generic loss function for partitions is able to estimate the partition losses within 2% of that from the detailed loss assessment.

Dynamic analyses are carried out to investigate the response of cylindrical liquid storage tanks under near-fault earthquakes. The studies are carried out for ground supported, anchored without isolation and base-isolated anchored tanks, where the isolator considered is lead-rubber bearing. Two types of configurations of the cylindrical liquid storage tanks, i.e. broad and slender, are considered in the present study. Equivalent pulse type acceleration inputs are used to study their effectiveness to predict the seismic response of base-isolated liquid storage tanks. The response under equivalent pulse type acceleration inputs are compared with the response under recorded near-fault earthquake ground accelerations. The response under the residual motion is also investigated to study their influence on the different response time histories. The cylindrical liquid storage tanks are subjected to bi-directional earthquake excitation to examine the effect of the interaction between two mutually perpendicular displacement components of the isolator. Parametric studies were conducted to investigate the variation of the peak response with important isolator parameters such as isolation time period, characteristic strength and isolation damping. It is observed that equivalent pulses are suitable for predicting the unidirectional response for slender liquid storage tanks; however, under the bi-directional excitation, prediction of the response is less accurate. The effect of the interaction is observed more crucial for lower isolation time periods under bi-directional excitation.

It is evident from the post-earthquake reconnaissance studies, such as Mexico city earthquake (1985), Nepal earthquake (2015), etc., that the buildings adjacent to each other experience damage due to pounding during strong earthquakes. Often the adjacent buildings are of different floor heights due to architectural or site requirements. Thus, it is important to study the effect of unequal slab levels, in adjacent buildings, on the seismic pounding. In this study, two adjacent reinforced concrete (RC) frames, 2-story and 4-story with three different slab levels are considered. Finite element modelling of these RC frames is done in ABAQUSv2021 [Abaqus 2011]. Non-linear elastic contact is modelled in between the considered frames. Three different ground motion records are considered to perform non-linear time history analyses. The seismic responses, such as peak interstory drift ratio, peak floor acceleration, pounding force, total energy dissipation, and damage index are studied. It is observed that the responses, such as peak interstory drift and peak pounding force are critical in the frames with unequal floor levels in comparison to those with equal floor levels. Hence, it is concluded that drift-sensitive non-structural building components would be subjected to maximum damage in stiffer buildings with equal slab level interaction whereas in flexible building with two-third slab level interaction. At the same time, peak pounding force is maximum in adjacent buildings with slabs at two-third levels.</span></span></p>\n', '<p><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif\">Damage quantification;&nbsp;Engineering demand parameter;&nbsp;Non-linear time history analysis;&nbsp;Pounding;&nbsp;Seismic response;&nbsp;Unequal slab levels</span></span></p>\n', 'On My Page', '1', '2'),

Therefore, understanding the teleconnections of ENSO with the hydrometeorological phenomenon, such as floods and droughts, has been a key research direction for hydro-climatologists in the recent few decades. Droughts over most parts of the world have been previously reported to be influenced by the ENSO. Since India is one of the most drought-prone countries, therefore, a better understanding of these teleconnections would help immensely in better management of drought disasters. For the quantification of causal teleconnection between climatic indices and drought indices, the impact of nonlinearities on causalities has not been addressed well in the literature. Therefore, in this study, we present a nonlinear neural network-based Granger causality (NGCT) approach for the quantification of causal teleconnections between ENSO and droughts. The analysis of teleconnections between ENSO and dry/wet conditions over India has been presented using four climatic indices and two drought indices (Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI)) at four time-scales. The results of the NGCT were also compared with the traditional Granger causality test (LGCT) to elucidate the potential of nonlinear approaches in teleconnection analysis. Results suggest great potential of NGCT for the examination of the teleconnection of ENSO and Indian dry/wet conditions. The area under significant causality was found significantly higher for a nonlinear approach as compared to the traditional LGCT. Further, the impact of ENSO on evapotranspiration-based (i.e., computed using SPEI) drought was found more than precipitation-based drought (i.e., computed using SPI).</p>\r\n', '<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>A neural-network-based Granger-causality method has been applied for drought index teleconnection analysis with ENSO.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Very robust results were found using both linear and non-linear Granger causality.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Significant non-linear casual teleconnections over all parts of India were found between ENSO and dry/wet spells.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n', 'On My Page', '1', '1'),

This work incorporates a modification in the existing Interacting Particle-Kalman Filter (IPKF) to enhance its detection capability in presence of non-stationary noise processes. To achieve noise adaptability, the proposed algorithm recursively estimates and updates the current noise statistics using the post-IPKF residual uncertainty in prediction as a measurement which in turn enhances the optimality in the solution as well.</span></span></p>\r\n', '<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif\">statistical noise models</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif\">particle-kalman filter</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif\">optical solution</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif\">structure health monitoring(SHM)</span></span></span></p>\r\n', 'On My Page', '1', '1'),

The dynamics of SM is largely controlled by interaction between land and atmosphere. As an alternate to physics based models, the machine learning based tools have been shown to yield better accuracy in forecasting SM. However, the complexity in the process that controls SM at largely varying scale (from small size porous media to continental level climate) influence the forecast to have uncertainty. Hence, this paper aims at developing a modelling framework for forecasting daily SM up to 5 days lead time along with associated uncertainty. In this modeling, the uncertainty in initial point estimates of artificial neural network (ANN) parameters are re-estimated in a probabilistic framework using Particle filter. In order to reduce the high dimensionality of such problems, most sensitive parameters of the ANN model were identified through Sobol&rsquo;s sensitivity analysis. The SM and weather data collected from the R.J. Cook Agronomy Farm experimental field near Pullman, Washington, USA were used to demonstrate the proposed method. The overall results of the models were highly encouraging in terms of having a Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency of more than 0.90 in calibration and validation. Further, the parametric uncertainty of ANN model parameters have helped quantifying the uncertainty in the SM forecast and found within acceptable limits. The proposed framework, in turn, helped providing useful information when the models are used in decision making supported with associated uncertainty information.</span></span></p>\r\n', '<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif\"><span style=\"font-size:14px\">soil moisture (SM)</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif\"><span style=\"font-size:14px\">artificial neural network (ANN)</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif\"><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Sobol&rsquo;s sensitivity analysis</span></span></span></p>\r\n', 'On My Page', '1', '1'),

However, the inconclusive identification of the physical process(es) and driver(s) behind the nonstationarity challenges the identification of an appropriate model structure, and consequently might hinder its reliable implementation. To date, no solid consensus on whether the nonstationary HFA is always superior to the stationary HFA has been reached. Therefore, this paper aimed to advance the understanding of the stationary and nonstationary HFAs under nonstationary scenarios by illustratively comparing their performance in real applications, and examining the effects of the nonstationarity on the stationary HFA through a simulation study, especially from the perspective of the uncertainty. The investigation of the effects of the nonstationarity on the stationary HFA was conducted in two fundamental nonstationary scenarios, namely temporal trends in the mean and variance, in which the degree of nonstationarity was quantifiable and known&nbsp;<em>a priori</em>. The HFAs were conducted using the Particle Filter, a Bayesian filtering technique which was recently employed in the stationary HFA and was further extended for the nonstationary HFA in this paper. The illustrative comparison did not demonstrate a consistent superiority of either HFA approach in terms of both fitting efficiency and uncertainty. This result thus implied that the stationarity HFA could outperform the nonstationary HFA in some cases. Besides, the simulation investigation of the stationary HFA revealed that the increase of nonstationarity degree would lead to the deterioration in the analysis accuracy and the elevation of uncertainty.</span></span></p>\r\n', '<p><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif\"><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"color:#f39c12\">hydrological frequency analysis (HFA)</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif\"><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"color:#f39c12\">hydrometeorological data</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif\"><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"color:#f39c12\">fundamental nonstationary scenarios</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif\"><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"color:#f39c12\">Particle Filter</span></span></span></p>\r\n', 'On My Page', '1', '1'),

Shear stress distribution in a meandering section depends upon various factors like shape of cross section, slope and hydraulic radius etc. Among all these factors sinuosity is a crucial factor which affect the shear stress distribution in a meandering section. This research put forward the effect of variation in sinuosity on shear stress distribution. CFD(Computational Flow Dynamics) analysis is adopted over experimental work due to its reliability and accuracy. ANSYS 18.1 is used for the simulation of meandering channels. In this research we design three meandering channels with sinuosity values 1.47, 2.0 and 2.53. Each model is simulated for three different values of discharge i.e. 1,2 and 3 cumec. Hence a total of 9 models are created for the analysis. Meshing is done for the domain and its accuracy is examined by performing grid independence study. LES(Large Eddy Simulation) model is used to incorporate turbulence in the model. This model is chosen due to its better efficiency and accuracy over others in open channel simulations. The results show that shear stress on inner wall of meandering channel is more than that on outer wall. Velocity profiles are found to be in agreement with shear stress distribution.

This study was carried out on Bhuntar station located in data sparse Kullu valley of Higher Himalayas. After spatiotemporal analysis with the IMD station, a total of 117 clear sky Landsat 8 scenes and 1771 clear sky MODIS scenes were analyzed using Google Earth Engine (GEE). LST was computed on these scenes on GEE using the Statistical Mono-Window (SMW) technique. The satellite derived LST values were extracted at the Bhuntar station and compared with IMD in-situ data. The result revealed strong correlation (R&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;around 0.84) between Landsat-8 LSTs and T air . The averaged Night time LSTs obtained from MODIS Aqua and Terra satellites performed better than averaged Day time LSTs as the RMSE is lower during night time as compared to day time. The correlation between Landsat 8 derived LST is more in case of maximum T air than mean T air . Based on these correlation, we proposed empirical equations for calculating air temperature from remotely observed LSTs. We expect that our findings will be valuable in bridging data gaps in in situ monitoring with daily resolution.</p>\r\n<quillbot-extension-portal></quillbot-extension-portal>', '<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<quillbot-extension-portal></quillbot-extension-portal>', 'All of Above', '1', '1'),

The effect of the sacrificial blast wall on blast response of hillside buildings is studied for two blast locations, i.e., road at uphill plinth level (UPL) and the same at downhill plinth level (DPL). It is observed that the blast on the uphill side is more damaging for the considered hillside buildings except for 2-story buildings. Further, the sacrificial blast wall of height same as the perimeter wall is observed to be effective only for lower storied hillside buildings subjected to airburst.

The approach adopted combines a novel characteristic moisture profile function with Boltzmann-Matano&rsquo;s equation to obtain an analytical model for hydraulic diffusivity. The model has been validated through the simulation of water absorption profiles reported in independent experimental investigations and of the moisture content observed in laboratory experiments.

In Bangladesh, sediment color is a useful indicator of pore water As concentrations. The pore waters of orange sediments are usually associated with lower As concentrations (&lt;50 &micro;g/L) owing to abundant Fe-oxides which sorb As. Using this color signal as a guide, spectroscopic measurements alongside thermal treatment were extensively utilized for analyzing the properties of both Fe-oxides and clay minerals. This study uses Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and diffuse reflectance (DR) measurements along with thermal treatment to evaluate the solid-phase associations of As from sediment collected along the Meghna River in Bangladesh. The samples analyzed in this study were chosen to represent the various lithologies present at the study site and included riverbank sands (1 m depth), silt (6 m depth), aquifer sand (23 m depth), and a clay aquitard (37 m depth). The concentrations of sedimentary As and Fe were measured by X-ray fluorescence, and the spectroscopic measurements were taken on the samples prior to the thermal treatment. For the thermal treatment, sediment samples were placed in a preheated furnace at 600 &deg;C for 3 h. The thermal treatment caused a deepening of reddish-brown hues in all samples, and the greatest change in color was observed in the finer-grained samples. The FTIR spectral analysis revealed that the clay minerals were composed primarily of illite, smectite, and kaolinite. The DR results indicate that the majority of Fe in sands was present as goethite; however, in the clay and silt samples, Fe was incorporated into the structure of clay minerals as Fe(II). The amount of structural Fe(II) was strongly positively correlated with the sedimentary As concentrations, which were highest in the finer-grained samples. After thermal treatment, the concentrations of As in the finer-grained samples decreased by an average of 40%, whereas the change in the As concentrations of the sand samples was negligible. These findings indicate that significant proportions of solid-phase As may be retained by OM and Fe(II)-bearing clay minerals.</p>\r\n', '', 'On My Page', '1', '1'),

Even though the first method provides acceptable predictions of the lateral load carrying capacity, damage criteria obtained are often not too close to those experimentally observed. Conversely, the second model exhibits the sufficient level of complexity that allows not only to accurately predict the global behavior, but also provides crack patterns very close to those experimentally obtained, so being considered a reliable tool for analysis of URM buildings and further to devise strengthening schemes to reduce their seismic vulnerability.</p>\r\n', '<p>Unreinforced masonry</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Non-linear pushover analysis</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Masonry building</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Macro-model</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Homogenization approach</p>\r\n', 'On My Page', '1', '1'),

Strengthening of such buildings located in seismically active regions has become extremely important. Although numerous strengthening techniques have been suggested in the literature, most of these methods are either qualitative in nature or too expensive. In this study, effectiveness of a simple strengthening scheme for URM buildings using surface-mounted steel bands is evaluated by carrying out experimental, numerical, and analytical studies. Three full-scale single-room specimens, unstrengthened as well as strengthened using two configurations of the strengthening scheme, are first tested under quasi-static cyclic loading. The strengthening is found to significantly improve the lateral-load behavior of the URM building. The experimental response data are then used to develop finite-element models for carrying out a parametric numerical study. It is observed that even small cross-sectional area of steel bands are sufficient to improve the lateral-load behavior of URM buildings. There is no appreciable advantage of using higher cross-sectional area of the steel bands. Finally, regression analysis is carried out using the numerical data, and an empirical model is developed for estimation of the lateral strength of the strengthened building.</p>\r\n', '<p>Unreinforced masonry (URM) buildings; Quasi-static tests; Strengthening; Surface-mounted steel bands, Lateral load behaviour</p>\r\n', 'On My Page', '1', '1'),

Earth to air heat exchanger (EAHE) system can effectively reduce heating affects on buildings. An experimental study was carried out by designing EAHE system using low cost building materials like Bamboo (<em>Bambuseae</em>) and hydraform (cement and soil plaster) to reduce the energy consumption of buildings and minimize the impact of climate change. This system utilizes earth&rsquo;s constant subterranean temperature for naturally heating or cooling the inlet air. This study was carried out in the North Eastern part of India. An open loop EAHE system was developed to predict the heating and cooling potential of the system. Within the system locally available bamboos were used for constructing the tunnel pipes and soil-cement mixture plaster was used to enhance the conductivity of the bamboo pipes. Soil-cement mixtures are capable of decreasing the humidity by 30 to 40&nbsp;%. Majority of the North Eastern region of India, have humid climatic conditions through out the year. Experiment was performed continuously for 7&nbsp;days and the result shows that irrespective to the inlet air temperature (ranges from 35&nbsp;&deg;C to 42&nbsp;&deg;C), outlet air temperature was recorded between 25&nbsp;&deg;C and 26&nbsp;&deg;C, which shows the effectiveness of the system. After a series of experimental analysis the study reveals that underground tunnel based fresh air delivery system is one of the easily feasible and economically feasible techniques which can drastically reduce the energy consumption of the buildings and help in addressing the continuously escalating demand of power and minimizing the impact of changing climatic conditions on buildings.</p>\r\n', '', 'On My Page', '1', '1'),

A weighted averaging approach has been adopted for generation of combined dispersion curve from individual experimental dispersion curves. Weights were calculated based on a triangular reliability distribution function that takes into account the gradual existence of near field and far field effect on the data. The analysis also includes a systematic data reduction procedure to account for the scatter in dispersion curve to reduce the complexity during inversion procedure.

As occurrence of permafrost is mostly governed by climatic conditions and circumstances, hence, in most cases, warming of air causes permafrost to warm or thaw. The climate has been warming rapidly in recent decades, and as a result, the permafrost component of the cryosphere has changed drastically. Permafrost is a structurally heterogeneous environment with many varieties of permafrost in various geographical locations and climatic zones. Furthermore, there are variances between geographical locations in terms of topography, permafrost structure, organic-matter concentration, and age. However, the permafrost regions, that are diversely distributed, are less understood for its temporal changes. Permafrost characteristics that may act on local or global scales must be better understood. Hence in this work, we have taken the permafrost regions of the world and categorised based on their geographical zones (polar, temperate and tropical) and topography (mountainous, plain area). We took wide range of permafrost locales such as of Alaska, Canada, Russia, China, the European Alps, and Himalayan permafrost areas, existing in a variable environmental condition. For each of these locations we used Land Surface Temperature (LST), Mean Annual Air Temperature (MAAT), Mean Annual Ground Temperature (MAGT), snow depth, amount of Incoming Solar Radiation etc of Continuous, and Discontinuous Permafrost to study the temporal behaviour of Permafrost regions in the warming climate for the last 2 decades (2000 &ndash; 2020). The studies envelop a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. We took the observed data from the Global Terrestrial Network as well as the remotely sensed satellite data of Landsat 5, Landsat 8 and ERA Interim reanalysis product for analysing the changes that have happened in the past 20 years. Our result shows, the permafrost of polar regions exhibits a similar pattern while there is clear distinction in the permafrost of polar and tropical areas. The permafrost temperature of temperate mountainous region is warmer than polar planar regions. Thus, the effect of global warming on permafrost is quite evident but it is most pronounced in mountainous regions.</p>\r\n', '<p>Permafrost; Land Surface Temperature; Mean Annual Temperature; Mean Annual Ground Temperature; Incoming Solar Radiation</p>\r\n', 'All of Above', '1', '1'),

Estimating and assessing the permafrost distribution in the Himalayan mountains is required for vulnerability assessment. While current global mountain permafrost distribution models provide a good understanding of permafrost distribution at the national/regional level, they struggle to show its local-scale variability. This work shows finer scale modelling of the permafrost distribution for the Kinnaur district, Himachal Pradesh, India using machine learning algorithm. We utilised six parameters namely slope, aspect, curvature, normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalised difference moisture index (NDMI) and mean annual air temperature (MAAT) along with rock glaciers to prepare the probable permafrost distribution map using support vector machine (SVM). We derived NDVI, NDMI and MAAT using Landsat-8 imagery and obtained slope, aspect, and curvature from ALOS PALSAR DEM. The performance of the model was assessed using five cross-validation techniques, including hold-out validation, k-fold cross-validation, stratified k-fold cross-validation, leave-one-out cross-validation, and repeated random train test split. The model achieved an AUC value of around 91% for all the cases, and the resulting map was validated using field images from crowd-sourced images. This study provides a high-resolution representation of permafrost distribution in the Kinnaur Himalayas. The probable permafrost area was found to be 27.3% of the total study region.

These landforms are characterized by a mixture of rock and ice, and their movement and deformation provide important clues about the thermal state of the underlying permafrost. The presence of permafrost significantly impacts the stability of the landforms and the associated geomorphological processes, as well as the water balance in the surrounding catchment. Integrating different conditioning factors and rock glaciers makes it possible to infer the distribution and evolution of permafrost in these environments. In this study, we aim to use rock glaciers as a proxy for permafrost and to develop a hybrid permafrost model by combining both statistical and machine learning models. We have used the Frequency Ratio (FR) ensembled Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to predict permafrost distribution over the Northern Kargil region of the Indian Himalayas.

This can make the area prone to landslides, rockfall, or slumps and even potentially lead to the collapse of entire mountain slopes. Although it is challenging to monitor catastrophic landslides in real time, non-catastrophic slow-moving landslides, which move downslope for months to decades (or even centuries) at rates ranging from millimeters to several meters per year, provide an excellent opportunity to study landslide processes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Slow-moving landslides cause significant erosion, regulate hill slope angles and topographic relief, and are a principal geologic hazard that damages infrastructure. A potential consequence of climate warming drives these slope failures, wherein the warmer summer-air temperatures and more significant rainfall events over seasonal time scale through increased pore-water pressure drive heat into the active layer, melting ice and decreasing soil shear strength. Warming also triggers permafrost thawing, which causes active layer detachment failure, further leading to retrogressive thaw slumping and localized surficial landslide. Rapid permafrost thaw alters the geotechnical properties of the hillslope, including reduced cohesion and increased hydraulic connectivity, making hillslopes more susceptible to landslides. In addition, the topography can potentially exacerbate land-sliding by controlling ground ice distribution and water movement in the subsurface. Using field and aerial remote-sensing measurements of the morphological and morphometric characteristics of the landslides, we can assess the influence of thawing ground ice on their propagation style and dynamics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, the satellite-based interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data can be analyzed alongside precipitation and groundwater data to explore hydrologic controls on landslide motion.

Then, groundwater flow and contaminant transport equations were solved via spatial analyst toolbox in the ArcGIS environment. Results showed the highest movement of the center of mass (COM) of plume for the sandstone lithological unit compared to the clay and sandy gravel layer. The maximum concentration value of reactive contaminant in the clay lithological unit was more than two times that of conservative contaminant. An increase in the contaminant concentration was observed with an increase in the retardation factor and ratio of longitudinal to transverse dispersivity based on the maximum and standard deviation values. The ratio of longitudinal and transverse dispersivity was observed as a highly sensitive parameter to the magnitude of contaminant concentration, followed by lithological unit type and retardation factor. Also, the location of COM of plume along longitudinal path track line was found to be governed by lithological unit and retardation factor.

The spectra from the&nbsp;standard spectral library were compared with the values of vegetation and snow spectral reflectance produced from corrected reflectance images. The mean values of snow and vegetation reflectance were higher for FLAASH, 6SV, and SIAC methods as compared to other methods. Therefore, FLAASH, 6SV, and SIAC methods, in contrast to other used atmospheric correction methods, have a high possibility of giving accurate snow and vegetation cover mapping. The snow cover and vegetation cover map prepared using NDSI and NDVI showed that areas covered under thin clouds and haze were better extracted when FLAASH, SIAC, and 6SV methods are applied as compared to other methods. Thus, this study confirms that physics-based atmospheric correction models such as FLAASH, SIAC, and 6SV methods should be used while working on satellite images of the&nbsp;Himalayan region where the focus is on snow and vegetation cover mapping.</p>\r\n', '', 'All of Above', '1', '1'),

The selection of study areas in most studies is random and depends on a variety of parameters such as the number of landslide occurrences, availability of preparatory causal factors or conditioning factors, availability of computational resources. However, the selected study area and mapping unit may not represent landslide occurrences in the whole basin or landslide susceptibility&nbsp;of the region. This work analyses and problematizes the effect of scale (smaller to the larger, i.e., basin-wise to micro-watershed) in preparation of LSM based on various landslide conditioning factors. The study has been carried out in the Mandakini river basin of Garhwal Himalaya, Uttarakhand. To evaluate the effect of geographical and computational scale, we have divided the river basin into ten sub-basins and further into 88 micro-watersheds. The study considers an inventory of 229 landslides (consisting of approximately 6000 pixels) and seven predisposing factors of landslide occurrence, i.e., aspect, elevation, geology, slope, soil, the buffer of streams, and buffer of thrusts. To compare the effect of scale, we have used two widely known techniques, namely Fisher discriminant analysis and logistic regression. The results of this study are validated on more than 230 landslide locations provided by the Geological Survey of India using the Heidke skill score, which is preferred for the assessment of rare events in predictive analysis. We conclude that logistic regression performs better for the whole basin and sub-basins. However, discriminant analysis performs better for micro-watersheds. Furthermore, based on the results we can conclude that if LSM is required at a sub-basin or micro-watershed scale, all categorical data must be prepared&nbsp;at a&nbsp;finer scale.</p>\r\n', '', 'All of Above', '1', '1'),

The method selects shape-preserving, discriminative bands which can highlight the important characteristics, variations as well as patterns of the hyperspectral data such that the differences between data from different classes become more apparent. The selection is performed in two stages. The first stage is selection of shape-preserving, keypoint bands which explain the trend characteristics of the reflectance curves in the hyperspectral data. These bands are able to preserve the functional representation of the curves as close as possible to their original representation using all the bands. The second stage involves selection of bands with good discriminative capabilities from the previously selected keypoint bands. For this, a novel iterative band selection technique using supervised functional principal component analysis (SFPCA) is proposed. The proposed band selection algorithm is the first approach reported in literature to explore the functional behaviour of HSI.

Therefore, criteria can be evaluated based on the understanding developed from local conditions, as it might be tedious to perform slope stability analysis for such large areas. Thus, an extensive site investigation was conducted in a study area subjected to numerous slope failures in Mandi, India. The primary goal of this study was to investigate the factors contributing to the slope failures. The present study was planned in the area anticipated for anthropogenic landslides due to construction activities. Hence, a series of geotechnical tests were performed, and the corresponding data from 26 soil samples obtained from different sites (with and without slope failures) of the Mandi region were employed for the current study. The geotechnical characteristics were determined using field and laboratory investigations from the collected soil samples, and thereby, their relationship with the slope failure occurrences was evaluated using multivariate correlation analysis. The results revealed that the most influential parameters for slope instability in this study area are saturated permeability, porosity, suction, in-situ density, in-situ water content and the angle of internal friction.

Researchers and analysts from the remote sensing community give greater preference to band selection over feature extraction as the latter modifies the original reflectance values of hyperspectral data, making it difficult to understand the behavior of the materials in terms of their reflectance values. However, feature extraction strategies have their own advantages which cannot be ignored. Thus, a two-level, PCA-based band selection framework is proposed to unify the two dimensionality reduction strategies so that benefits of both the strategies can be derived. The proposed approach selects bands based on their relationship with a given set of principal components explained in terms of component loadings, thus keeping the original bands intact. Additionally, contrary to the popular notion that the complete information of all bands is adequately coalesced in the top principal components, middle principal components play a far stronger discriminative role when the competing classes are spectrally confusing to each other. Thus, for each level of classification, a different range of principal components is used to select the bands, on the basis of the level of spectral similarity expected between the classes at each level. Experimental results indicate that the proposed two-level band selection algorithm can select bands with varying levels of discriminative capabilities to effectively classify hyperspectral images consisting of classes spectrally very similar in nature.</p>\r\n', '', 'All of Above', '1', '1'),

In this article, a feature extraction-based, clustering-ranking type band selection method is proposed in which the band selection is performed in two stages. In the clustering stage, a new and improved representation of bands using their component loadings for the top principal components is introduced, which is employed to cluster similar bands into groups using sparse subspace clustering. In the ranking stage, a new metric called combined divergence-correlation index is introduced to elect the most discriminative as well as least correlated bands as cluster representatives. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method can proficiently select a set of distinct and discriminative bands, which can help in effective hyperspectral classification.

The study using porous-puff shows that the contaminant plume area increases with an increase in time and the concentration decreases with the increasing depth below the dumping site. It is observed that the plume area is larger at 36 m (Z = 230 m) depth as compared to plume area at other depths due to the presence of sandstone layer around the dumping site at 36 m (Z = 230 m) depth. The ground water velocity is higher in sandstone layer at 36 m (Z = 230 m) depth which cause higher dispersion of source concentration in comparison to layers at 6 m (Z = 260 m) and 26 m (Z = 240 m) depths.

An alternative is the application of drones for such mapping. This study presents the utility of drone/unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for mapping and 3D reconstruction of two landslides near IIT Mandi, Himachal Pradesh. In this study, we used DJI Phantom 3 Advanced drone to collect high-resolution images of landslides. Features in the images were automatically detected, described, and matched among photographs using scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) technique. The 3D position and orientation of the cameras and the XYZ location of each feature in the photographs was estimated using bundle block adjustment. This resulted in sparse 3D point cloud, which was densified using Clustering View for Multi-View Stereo (CMVS) algorithm. Finally, surface reconstruction was done using Poisson Surface Reconstruction method, which was visualised in open source software CloudCompare. The 3D model, generated from drone images, was validated using field measurements of some objects, and 3D surface created from total station. Various quantities i.e. width (length), height and perimeter were measured in the 3D drone model and verified with total station data. The differences among all the measured quantities for both the landslides are less than 5% keeping the measurements of total station as reference. The 3D reconstructed from the sets of photographs is very accurate giving the measurements up to cm level and even small objects could be easily identified. In addition, digital elevation model (DEM) of sub meter resolution could be easily generated and used for various applications. Hence drone-based imagery in combination with 3D scene reconstruction algorithms provide flexible and effective tools to map and monitor landslide apart from accurately assessing the dimensions of the landslides.</p>\r\n', '', 'All of Above', '1', '1'),

In this work the possible sources of fluoride contamination in Rihand reservoir water is constrained. They include slurry water, fly ash and coal samples of various thermal power plants, coal seams and granites of the region. Petrographic study depicted the presence of fluoride bearing minerals - flour apatite in pink granite. Preliminary scanning electron microscope studies revealed presence of fluorine peak in coal samples. The chemical analysis confirmed the presence of fluoride in fly ash (12.6 mg/kg), drain water (5.34 mg/l), soil (6.1 mg/kg), coal (3.1 mg/kg). They confirmed the source of fluoride from coal of thermal power plant which utilized coal from Singrauli coal seam (1.6 mg/kg). Further the Rihand reservoir water is also enriched by fluoride contaminant (upto 4.7 mg/l). This contaminates groundwater of the area as well. The contaminated water used for drinking and agriculture affects health of inhabitants in the area.

Petrography and Raman spectroscopy of the serpentinite suggest that they are serpentinized ultramafic cumulate and peridotite. The serpentinization may have occurred at a condition of low pressure and low temperature metamorphism. Geochemical signatures of the rocks and spinel grains revealed that the protolith be an abyssal peridotite, derived from a less depleted fertile mantle melt at a MORB setting after low degree (10&ndash;15%) partial melting. The study concluded that the serpentinite may have been created at a slow-spreading ridge, rather than a supra-subduction-zone setting. These rocks were later obducted and incorporated into the IMR of Indo-Myanmar suture zone.</p>\r\n', '', 'All of Above', '1', '1'),

These NW‐SE faults/thrusts were also identified by GPR (Ground‐Penetrating Radar) surveys, using 200 MHz and 100 MHz antennas, carried out at 8 areas. Nearly 200 GPR profiles were taken and the best results were obtained near the Timarpur, Vasant Vihar, Mehrauli and Faridabad areas. The radar profiles were processed using low‐ and high‐pass Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters, for noise removal and Automatic Gain Control (AGC) for amplitude correction to enhance the data. The Bouguer gravity anomaly analysis confirms the presence of two NW‐SE trending faults viz. the Yamuna‐Timarpur‐Sonepat fault passing from the northern portion and the Faridabad‐Mehrauli‐Rohtak fault in the southern portion cutting across the city, thus implying the in‐between area as a graben. Moreover the fault plane solutions of the majority of the seismic events show orientation in a NW‐SE direction along the Delhi Sargodha ridge (DSR). These faults are sub‐parallel to Himalayan thrust systems and have reverse fault characteristics. Hence, the possibility of finding more hidden faults beneath the Indo‐Gangetic alluvium, sub‐parallel to the regional strike of the Himalayan fault system cannot be ruled out.</p>\r\n', '', 'All of Above', '1', '1'),

Arctic and Himalayan glaciers form an important part of the cryoshphere. Kongsbreen, Kronoebreen and Infantfonna are some among the fast flowing tidal glaciers in Svalbard Region. The Bhadal glacier, Kangra in the Himalayan Region is a significant mountainous glacier feeding the Bhadal Nala. Both have been an area of research for decades to understand the variations in climate. Due to remoteness of the study regions, an attempt has been made to use remote sensing techniques to estimate the glacier surface velocity of these glaciers at both of the regions. In the present study, both the optical and the SAR satellite data were used to estimate glacier velocity. The Optical Feature Tracking method is used to estimate glacier velocity with LANDSAT 8 OLI optical dataset on annual scale. Also the Offset Tracking method which makes use of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) datasets was also used to estimate the seasonal change in the velocity in these glaciers at seasonal scale. Using Optical Feature Tracking the maximum surface velocity of the Kongsbreen, Kronebreen and Infantfonna glaciers combined is estimated to be 2.49m/day (2016-2017), 2.54m/day (2017-2018) and 2.69m/day (2018-2019). The maximum average velocity using Offset Tracking Method is 2.57m/day (2017), 2.54 m/day (2018), 2.72 m / day (2019). The results for the Bhadal Glacier will be presented later on. The increase in velocity is suggestive of decrease or loss of glacial mass for both the regions. It has been observed that for Tidal glaciers the results of Optical Feature Tracking and Offset Feature Tracking are quite comparable whereas for the Mountain Glacier Offset Feature Tracking provides more accurate value as Optical Feature Tracking is subjected to less coherence. Overall results are suggestive of impact of climate change on the glaciers as both of them have increased rate of melting.

Several research has been carried out in recent years for the recognition, mapping, monitoring, and forecasting the landslide events in both small and large regions worldwide. Therefore, to understand the catastrophic phenomenon of landslides, remote sensing, and GIS-enabled statistical methods are widely used nowadays. Thus, landslide-caused calamities can be effectively managed and mitigated using a landslide susceptibility map (LSM) that identifies the potential landslide areas. The landslide susceptibility mapping using sampling ratio techniques is important for enhancing the accuracy of the LSM prepared with frequency ratio (FR)statistical models. Hence, this research evaluates the effect of sampling ratio on LSM for the Kangra district using the FR method. Therefore, to evaluate the efficiency of the sampling method, this work uses 559 landslide points obtained from the Bhukosh GSI portal. The obtained landslide points were then randomly divided into training and testing landslide points using four sampling ratios (60:40, 70:30, 80:20, and 90:10). With the combination of sampling ratios and seven causative factors including aspect, distance to road, distance to lineament, distance to river, elevation, lithology, and slope, the four LSM were prepared using the frequency ratio method. Further, the accuracy of the four resulting LSM was assessed using the area under the curve (AUC) receiver operator characteristics (ROC) curve. The results obtained for the 80:20 sample ratio was higher (figure 1a) (AUC = 0.892) than the other sampling ratios of 60:40(AUC = 0.872)(figure 1b), 70:30 (AUC = 0.879)(figure 1c), and 90:10 (AUC = 0.862)(figure 1d). Thus, the results showed that an 80:20 sampling ratio is effective and viable for identifying and mapping local landslides.

A wide variation in AOD, (range 0.07 to 3.49) and AE, (range 0-1.8) is observed during 2000-2019 over Delhi and surrounding regions. This shows very poor air quality and highly polluted atmospheric. Different aerosol types are found to be season dependent based on the detailed analysis of AOD and AE retrieved from satellite data during the period 2000-2019. The present analysis shows dominance of anthropogenic aerosols (AA) during winter whereas biomass burning (BB) during post monsoon seasons. During pre monsoon season pollutant continental (PC) and mostly dust (MD) were observed for many days as air mass travel from Thar Desert, Middle East and Arabia with the westerly winds. In the recent decade, clean days in Delhi are reduced significantly.</p>\r\n', '', 'All of Above', '1', '1'),

The objective of this paper is to identify the various land resources and its changes into other Land Use Land Cover (LULC) type. LANDSAT satellite data for 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2018 years of Kailali district Nepal was acquired for supervised LULC mapping and change analysis using ENVI 5.4 software. Sentinel-2 and Google earth satellite data were used for the accuracy assessment of the LULC map. The time-series data analysis from 1990&ndash;2000&ndash;2010&ndash;2018 shows major changes in vegetation and agriculture. The changes in LULC show that settlement and bare land is continuously increasing throughout these years. The change in land use and land cover during the period of 1990&ndash;2018 shows that the settlement area is increased by 204%; and agriculture is decreased by 57%. The fluctuating behavior of vegetation, agriculture and water bodies in which the areas decrease and increase over the selected periods is due to natural calamities and migration of the local population. This shows that human influence on the land resources is accelerating and leading to a deterioration of agricultural land. Thus effective agricultural management practices and policies should be carried out at the government level for minimizing land resources degradation by the human-induced impact.</p>\r\n', '', 'All of Above', '1', '1'),

This under-represented data and severe class distribution skew create a data imbalance for learning algorithms and suboptimal models, which are biased towards the majority class (non-landslide pixels) and have low performance on the minority class (landslide pixels).

The slide was so huge that it eroded more than 300-meter stretch of NH-154 killing over 50 people with more than 40 missing. Local residents report that this area has always been unstable where small landslides had occurred in the past. The landslide scar could be seen on the past satellite images from December 2001 to March 2017 on Google Earth. A huge landslide occurred at this location on 13 August 1977. After two decades on 13 August 1997, the landslide reactivated and some part of the slope failed, which can be seen on satellite images of the year 2001. The landslide reactivated again on 13 August 2007, but not much attention was given to it, as it was a small event and did not affect much. Again, after a decade, in the night of 12 August 2017 this landslide was reactivated. There is the possibility of reoccurrence of slope instability from upper reaches of the crown area of the main slide complex as well as the debris, which have been already accumulated on hill and valley side.

We have considered eight-grid boxes (2&deg;x2&deg;) in coastal and Himalayan states for detailed analysis of rainfall and water vapor data retrieved from satellite for the periods 2003-2018. The rainfall deficit years 2004 and 2005, 2007 and 2013 excess rainfall years and 2008 and 2010 years of normal rainfall are considered. From detailed analysis, we observed that the coastal states as well as Himalayan states show wet and dry periods at every 4-5 years cycle, the rainfall amount was more than two times compared to the coastal regions. Monsoon pattern in Himalayan region is complex due to interaction of topography and other physical parameters. In the western Himalayan region, the amount of rainfall varies over west to central Himalaya. In plains, the water vapor content increases as compared to the coastal regions, which could be due to the existing and increasing anthropogenic activities. A strong relationship between water vapor and rainfall in north and northeastern parts of India, while weak relationship for coastal regions have been observed. The water vapor content in coastal region shows a time lag of 4-5 days with respect to rainfall. Detailed analysis will be discussed to show dependence of the Indian Summer Monsoon on the strong coupling between land-ocean-atmosphere that leads to inter-decadal variability in climatic conditions.</p>\r\n', '', 'All of Above', '1', '1'),

We represent the dataset in the form of similarity graphs computed from metrics such as Euclidean, and Tanimoto Similarity using K-Nearest neighbor method. The optimum k for our dataset is identified using methods like Distribution Compactness (DC) algorithm, elbow plot, histogram and visual inspection of the similarity graphs.

Topographic shading creates ambiguity among different elements of scene having similar hue and saturation but different intensities, which leads to misinterpretation of surface features. Due to this effect, there is high variability in the reflectance response of similar vegetation types i.e. sunny areas show more than actual reflectance, whereas shaded areas show less than expected reflectance. In this paper, the effects of digital elevation model (DEM) has been assessed on topographic correction of Sentinel-2 satellite images. TanDEM-X digital elevation model with spatial resolution of 12 meters is used in the study. DEMs was resampled at 10 meters to match the spatial resolution of satellite image. In this research work, six known methods of corrections are compared: the cosine, semi-empirical C, Minnaert, CHuang Wei, SCS + C and VECA correction depending on the solar incidence angle and exitance angle. Correlations and linear regressions between reflectance values of satellite image and topographic parameters (slope, aspect derived from DEM) are investigated. Ideally, the slope of regression line between illumination condition and image band should be zero, as topography should not control the solar illumination over terrain. However, in hilly regions, topography plays a critical role by controlling the amount of sunlight falling on north and south faces of mountains. Hence, after application of topographic correction methods, this slope of regression line decreases. Coefficient of variation, mean and standard deviation was used for the statistical analysis of the results obtained after topographic correction. The results of the study shows that classical cosine method overcorrect the image. As seen from the statistical analysis, VECA correction method provides good correction of topography.

Since the mid of last century many large glaciers in Himalayas have disintegrated to smaller glaciers primarily due to global warming (Kulkarni et al. 2007; Shrestha et al. 2012). During this glacier melt, several glacial lakes form up in the vicinity of retreating glaciers or from their melt water (Jain et al. 2012). These glacial lakes are mostly situated in elevation between 3000-5000 m elevations and are formed in unstable regions. During Glacial lake outburst fl oods (GLOF), they can produce discharge rates of 30,000 m3 sec&minus;1 which can cover over 200 km in downstream region (Richardson 2000). Thus, a detailed approach is required to mark out these potential risky lakes before they begin to get into severe conditions.

This area consists of weak and unstable lithology, highly fragile rocks due to the complicated tectonic settings; consequently, landslide movement is a common phenomenon in the area. We have used several landslide controlling factors such as slope, lithology, thrust buffers, relative relief, land use land cover, lineaments, and stream buffer in order to generate a susceptibility map. We have prepared these parameters from geological (structural and lithological) maps, Landsat TM, and ASTER GDEM data and field investigation data. We have integrated the data based on the ordinal scale weightage rating technique to generate the landslide susceptibility index (LSI) values. The LSI frequency distribution is divided into five zones (i.e., very low, low, moderate, high, and very high susceptibility) based on the geometric interval as well as the standard deviation to enhance the classes with minimal frequency. These zones account for 3.30%, 20.88%, 47.99%, 41.13%, and 1.83% of total area respectively.

Scarcity of water has become a global cause of concern, especially in megacities. These cities are facing water stress due to several reasons, but mainly it can be attributed to continuous population growth and inadequate water management. Other factors like climate change, geographical location, and economic conditions also play a role in water scarcity. In megacities, water scarcity can be generally divided into economic and physical scarcity. Economic water scarcity includes poor infrastructure investment and poor technology for acquiring water, while physical water scarcity includes environmental dilapidation and groundwater depletion. This chapter presents an overview on the development of megacities and focuses on the water challenges faced by them. It assesses the problems and factors which are the cause of mounting water stress in megacities. In addition, the chapter proposes possible solutions to water scarcity experienced by megacities and raises concerns about the persistent growth of megacities.</p>\r\n', '', 'All of Above', '1', '1'),

It is the most common natural hazard in the mountain regions and can result in enormous damage to both property and life every year. Better understanding of the hazard will help people to live in harmony with the pristine nature. Since India has 15% of its land area prone to landslides, preparation of landslide susceptibility zonation (LSZ) maps for these areas is of utmost importance. These susceptibility zonation maps will give the areas that are prone to landslides and the safe areas, which in-turn help the administrators for safer planning and future development activities. There are various methods for the preparation of LSZ maps such as based on Fuzzy logic, Artificial Neural Network, Discriminant Analysis, Direct Mapping, Regression Analysis, Neuro-Fuzzy approach and other techniques. These different approaches apply different rating system and the weights, which are area and factors dependent. Therefore, these weights and ratings play a vital role in the preparation of susceptibility maps using any of the approach. However, one technique that gives very high accuracy in certain might not be applicable to other parts of the world due to change in various factors, weights and ratings. Hence, only one method cannot be suggested to be applied in any other terrain. Therefore, an understanding of these approaches, factors and weights needs to be enhanced so that their execution in Geographic Information System (GIS) environment could give better results and yield actual ground like scenarios for landslide susceptibility mapping.</p>\r\n', '', 'All of Above', '1', '1'),

The haphazard growth of built infrastructure in hilly regions is highly vulnerable to impending earthquakes. Most of the highly populous cities in the Indian. Himalayan region come under seismic zone V [1]. Therefore, it is important to perform seismic vulnerability assessment of built infrastructure, especially buildings in hilly regions, to predict the expected seismic damage. To conduct mass level seismic vulnerability assessment of buildings, rapid visual screening can be opted as a tool to quickly segregate them based on their expected performance. In this study, rapid visual screening of 1009 buildings is performed in Mandi region of Himachal Pradesh, India. Out of them, 81 buildings are important such as hospitals, educational institutes, hotels, and government buildings. Table 1 shows the total number of different important buildings surveyed in the study area, along with their typology and tentative occupant count. It is observed that in the Mandi region, important buildings constructed with stone masonry are still functional to their full capacity. Moreover, important buildings are assessed based on different structural irregularities, such as soft story, setback, plan irregularity, etc., present in them. Figure 1 shows the number of buildings in which different irregularity parameters are observed. It is noticed that the presence of structural irregularities such as lack of adequate walls and plan irregularity are very common. Apart from structural irregularities, it is also noticed that buildings are poorly maintained in terms of water seepage and cracks in non-structural building components. Furthermore, three different rapid visual screening methods, FEMA P154 [2], Sreerama et al. [3], and NDMA [4], are used to assess the important buildings in the study area. Some consistencies in the results of the expected damage grade of the building are also observed that emphasize on the need to improve the existing rapid visual screening methods for the buildings in the hilly region.</p>\r\n', '<p>Assessment; Buildings; Hilly Regions; Important Buildings; Rapid Visual Screening; Seismic Vulnerability Assessment; Seismic Hazard; Structural Irregularities</p>\r\n', 'On My Page', '1', '1'),

It is evident from the post-earthquake reconnaissance studies, such as Mexico city earthquake (1985), Nepal earthquake (2015), etc., that the buildings adjacent to each other experience damage due to pounding during strong earthquakes. Often the adjacent buildings are of different floor heights due to architectural or site requirements. Thus, it is important to study the effect of unequal slab levels, in adjacent buildings, on the seismic pounding. In this study, two adjacent reinforced concrete (RC) frames, 2-story and 4-story with three different slab levels are considered. Finite element modelling of these RC frames is done in ABAQUSv2021 [Abaqus 2011]. Non-linear elastic contact is modelled in between the considered frames. Three different ground motion records are considered to perform non-linear time history analyses. The seismic responses, such as peak interstory drift ratio, peak floor acceleration, pounding force, total energy dissipation, and damage index are studied. It is observed that the responses, such as peak interstory drift and peak pounding force are critical in the frames with unequal floor levels in comparison to those with equal floor levels. Hence, it is concluded that drift-sensitive non-structural building components would be subjected to maximum damage in stiffer buildings with equal slab level interaction whereas in flexible building with two-third slab level interaction. At the same time, peak pounding force is maximum in adjacent buildings with slabs at two-third levels.</p>\r\n', '<p>Adjacent Buildings; Drift-Sensitive Non-Structural Components; Pounding; Pounding Force; Seismic Gap; Seismic Pounding; Unequal Floor Levels.</p>\r\n', 'On My Page', '1', '2'),

Building in these areas requires both strong engineering skills and quality control. The scarcity of flat land and the increasing population have driven the construction of buildings on slopes in hilly regions. Unlike buildings on flat land, buildings in hilly areas typically follow the natural slope of the ground for support and exhibit unique structural configurations, namely step back (SB) and split foundations (SF). However, past earthquakes, such as the Sikkim earthquake in 2011, have demonstrated that buildings with these configurations, even if constructed with reinforced concrete (RC) following code guidelines, are prone to severe damage. Torsional irregularities arise due to the presence of short columns at intermediate stories, and substandard construction quality further exacerbates their vulnerability to seismic action. Consequently, the seismic losses for buildings in hilly areas are expected to differ significantly from those for buildings on flat land. This study focuses on estimating the seismic losses associated with the structural components of nine RC building models designed according to recent Indian code recommendations. Nonlinear response history analysis is conducted to determine the peak seismic response in terms of interstory drift ratio (IDR), an important engineering demand parameter (EDP) for seismic loss estimation. The seismic repair losses corresponding to the structural components are estimated using the performance-based earthquake engineering framework provided by the Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research (PEER) center. The analysis reveals that the pattern of story drift and peak floor acceleration in hilly buildings is non-uniform, characterized by sudden peaks at one or two levels depending on the foundation arrangements. As a result, the expected losses due to structural component damage at various floor levels significantly differ between typical buildings in hilly regions and those on flat land.</p>\r\n', '<p>Hilly Building; Interstory Drift Ratio; Loss Estimation.</p>\r\n', 'On My Page', '1', '1'),

One tool to quantify and identify the source of these losses is seismic loss estimation, which considers losses arising from building damage, occupancy disruption (downtime) and death/injury. While significant progress had been made to simplify loss estimation procedures for easier applications, they are still not readily usable in everyday engineering design practice. One reason for this is due to insufficient information being readily available regarding the inevitable variations in the type and density of different structural and non-structural building components present in buildings of different occupancy types. This study aims to establish groups of building occupancy types based on similar initial cost ratio of the three key performance groups; structural components, non-structural drift-sensitive components, and non-structural accelerationsensitive components. This involved extracting component construction/installation costs from a New Zealand construction cost handbook for a range of different building occupancy types, summing the costs based on the three performance groups, then grouping the occupancy types based on similar structural and non-structural component costs. Weighting factors for each performance group, which represent the ratio of the performance group cost to the total cost, were then proposed for each building occupancy group. It should be noted that while the methodology adopted in this study can be used in other regions, the specific values and building occupancy groups proposed in this paper is specific to New Zealand application. A total of 79 different occupancy types were considered and grouped into four different building occupancy categories. Mean values of the performance group weighting factors for each occupancy category was computed and proposed. A case study demonstrating the application of the proposed weighting factors in rapid seismic loss estimation is provided.

Multistory building models equipped with five different types of isolation systems, namely, the laminated rubber bearing (LRB), lead-rubber bearing (N-Z system), pure friction (PF) system, friction pendulum system (FPS), and resilient-friction base isolator (R-FBI) are assessed under bidirectional multihazard excitations. The suitability of the isolation systems and their key parameters in protecting multistory buildings is evaluated. Furthermore, the influence of the superstructure characteristics, such as the superstructure damping and the number of stories, is also assessed. The effect of bidirectional hazards on fixed-base buildings is also presented for comparison. The key response quantities of base-isolated buildings are presented and compared for different isolation systems. Parametric investigations are also conducted, and the trends of the response quantities are presented to study the influence of important parameters of isolation systems in protecting the buildings under the multihazard scenario of earthquake and BIGM. The results of the investigation show that the behaviors of the buildings equipped with various isolation systems are different for the two hazards. Moreover, the influences of the key parameters of the isolation systems are found to be different for various hazards.

Examples are shown in the Figure 1. It is clear that the next advancement in seismic engineering is to limit these losses. One framework which enables this to be done in practice follows the Loss Optimization Seismic Design framework (LOSD). To use this framework, weighting factors to estimate the contribution of structural, non-structural drift-sensitive, and non-structural acceleration-sensitive components to the overall construction cost for a given storey level (WS, WNS,DS, WNS,AS, respectively) for different building typologies are required as shown in Figure 2.

It is reported that most of the modern buildings, in the regions where modern seismic design practices are already in use, succeeded to achieve the life safety limit state during last few earthquakes (Canterbury earthquake 2010, 2011, South Napa earthquake 2014, Chile Earthquake 2015). However, the financial losses associated with every earthquake damaged buildings are enormous. Seismic loss assessment procedure following the PEER performance based design framework has been adopted and developed considerably during the last decade. The loss assessment tool PACT is already in use to estimate the probable seismic loss for buildings. Several other efforts have been made towards effective estimation of expected seismic losses during design life of a building. Nevertheless, use of the currently available tools requires substantial computational effort and prior knowledge of the loss assessment framework. For a designer without any background of seismic loss estimation, it is difficult to follow the current loss assessment framework or to use the available computer tools. Therefore, there is a serious need to develop a framework to rapidly estimate the expected seismic loss associated with a building within its design life. Herein, the preliminary development of a loss estimation framework is presented that enables the designer to estimate the expected seismic loss with little additional effort. Essentially, the framework is based on the concept of floor level loss estimation methodology reported in the existing literature. In Loss Optimization Seismic Design (LOSD), the designer can quickly estimate the seismic loss and revise the design to restrict the loss within a limit as prescribed by the stakeholders. The normalized losses per unit floor area of typical office building, at different level of inter story drift ratio and floor acceleration, are presented as examples of expected floor level loss functions. During the development of the generalized loss functions typical components, which primarily contribute to the seismic loss in an office building, are duly considered. The distributions of the components in office building are developed from the construction data collected through a rigorous field survey throughout Christchurch city, supplemented with available information in various literature. A designer, without any prior knowledge of the seismic loss estimation framework, can use the developed generalized floor level loss functions to estimate the expected seismic loss for a given hazard level within the current time frame of design process. The applicability of the generalized loss functions is verified with detailed loss calculation for a typical office building. It is observed that the developed generalized loss functions can estimate the expected seismic loss with reasonable accuracy. However, further investigations are required to increase the accuracy of the loss estimation using the generalized loss functions.</p>\r\n', '<p>Earthquake; Generalized Loss Function; Losd; Pact; Seismic Loss Assessment.</p>\r\n', 'On My Page', '1', '1'),

Considering the performance of modern earthquake resistant buildings observed in recent earthquakes, it could be broadly concluded that the collapse prevention objective is satisfactorily achieved in most cases. Nevertheless, the financial consequences due to the inevitable damage to structural and non-structural components of such earthquake resistant modern buildings have been found to be substantially high, and not acceptable to the stakeholders. Merely achieving the code based performance objectives (such as life safety and collapse prevention) does not satisfy the stakeholders concern when it comes to financial losses. To address this issue, FEMA P-58 (FEMA 2012) has put together a methodology based on the framework developed by the Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research (PEER) centre (Moehle and Deierlein 2004) for seismic loss assessment of structures. Considering the enormous attention paid towards the financial loss of earthquake induced damages, the next generation seismic design is expected to be based on the criteria that minimize the financial losses in addition to ensuring life safety. Earlier, Krawinkler et al. (2004) presented how the acceptable monetary loss can be viewed as the &lsquo;design target&rsquo; at the design level within the framework of performance based design. They further pointed out that the relationships between the monitory loss and the engineering demand parameters (EDPs) are to be developed extensively for efficient application of the loss-targeted design. Later, Dhakal (2010) proposed the concept of the loss optimization seismic design (LOSD). He conceptually presented how the widely used performance criteria, such as immediate occupancy or the collapse prevention, can be satisfied in the LOSD framework even without explicitly defining and checking for those performance criteria during the design. The need for easily understandable (for the nontechnical stakeholders such as owner, insurer or common user) performance objectives is growing rapidly after each earthquake occurrence; and minimisation of seismic losses (financial or otherwise) has emerged as an easily understandable and widely acceptable design criteria. Therefore, the concept of LOSD needs to be developed further to cater a seismic design approach that is acceptable to and meets the expectation of all stakeholders</p>\r\n', '<p>Collapse Prevention; Earthquake Resistant Buildings; Engineering Demand Parameters (Edps); Financial Losses; Framework; Life Safety; Loss Optimization Seismic Design (Losd)</p>\r\n', 'On My Page', '1', '1'),

Several studies have established the long-term economic benefits of using base isolation as earthquake mitigation technique through lifecycle cost analysis. However, selection of design parameters of the isolation system is crucial as they essentially influence the structural responses, and consequently the economic benefits in the long run. Researchers have recommended optimum parameters for the commonly used lead-rubber bearing (LRB) base isolation system. Nevertheless, it is understood that the prescribed optimum ranges of the parameters do not necessarily minimize the peak floor acceleration and the inter-story drift ratio, which are the primary engineering demand parameters (EDPs) for the seismic loss assessment of building, simultaneously. Therefore, it is necessary to study the influence of the isolator parameters on the seismic response of base-isolated buildings, when reduction in the expected financial loss is of concern. Herein, influence of the LRB properties on the expected seismic loss of base-isolated building is investigated. The seismic loss assessment framework developed by Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research (PEER) centre is used to estimate the expected financial loss. The expected financial losses due to earthquake damage, with and without considering the pounding at isolation level, are estimated for two different seismic hazard levels. It is observed that the characteristic parameters of the LRB, e.g. post- to pre-yield stiffness ratio and normalized yield strength, have noticeable effects on the peak responses at different floor levels, and consequently on the expected seismic loss of the building.</p>\r\n', '<p>Assessment; Base Isolation; Benefits; Building; Cost Analysis; Demand Parameters; Design; Earthquake; Economic; Expected; Financial Loss; Floor Acceleration;</p>\r\n', 'On My Page', '1', '1'),

Therefore, the wind induced response of base-isolated buildings are necessary to examine. Herein, a detailed comparison among the response of base-isolated buildings, isolated using various isolation systems, under wind load is reported. Thereafter, influence of variation in isolation time period, isolation damping ratio, superstructure flexibility and the magnitude of the wind load on the wind induced response are examined. The acceleration at the top floor and the bearing displacement (displacement at isolation level) are considered as the important response quantities. It is observed that elastomeric isolators are capable to reduce the wind induced vibration. It is concluded that increase in the isolation time period increases the top floor acceleration and bearing displacement for all types of isolators. It is also observed that the isolation damping has marginal effects on the bearing displacement. However, some isolation systems show beneficial effect to reduce the top floor acceleration with increasing damping.

A detailed case study is presented for three different building configurations commonly observed in the hilly region, i.e., 4-story stepback, 4-story split-foundation, and 4-story regular buildings. The variation in the floor-wise and component-wise repair cost ratio with varying levels of ground motion intensity is investigated. This study also proposes the expected repair cost ratio function for the considered building configurations corresponding to the four building components.

The buildings are idealized as single degree of freedom (SDOF) system and multi-degrees of freedom (MDOF) system with one lateral degree of freedom at each floor level. The isolation system is modeled using two different mathematical models such as: (i) code-recommended equivalent linear elastic-viscous damping model and (ii) bi-linear hysteretic model. The uncertain parameters of the isolator considered are time period, damping ratio, and yield displacement. Moreover, the amplitude and frequency of the sinusoidal base excitation function are considered uncertain. The uncertainty propagation is investigated using generalized polynomial chaos (gPC) expansion technique. The unknown gPC expansion coefficients are obtained by non-intrusive sparse grid collocation scheme. Efficiency of the technique is compared with the sampling method of Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. The stochastic response quantities of interest considered are bearing displacement and top floor acceleration of the building. Effects of individual uncertain parameters on the building response are quantified using sensitivity analyses. Effect of various uncertainty levels of the input parameters on the dynamic response of the building is also investigated. The peak bearing displacement and top floor acceleration are more influenced by the amplitude and frequency of the sinusoidal base excitation function. The effective time period of the isolation system also produces a considerable influence. However, in the presence of similar uncertainty level in the time period, amplitude and frequency of the sinusoidal forcing function, the effect of uncertainties in the other parameters of the isolator (e.g., damping ratio and yield displacement) is comparatively less. Interestingly, the mean values of the response quantities are found to be higher than the deterministic values in several instances, indicating the need of conducting stochastic analysis.

Efficiency analysis is performed to obtain suitable vector-valued intensity measures (vIMs) that ensure minimum deviation in seismic risk assessment. Fragility analysis is performed using stripe analysis, considering a defined damage state, in terms of the peak base shear (<em>V</em><sub><em>b</em>,<em>p</em></sub>) which is related to the elastic buckling of the tank wall, for a range of friction coefficients of the FPS. The annual joint probability of occurrence of the intensity measures (IMs) at the selected site is evaluated using vector-valued probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (VPSHA), and it is convoluted with the fragility functions for obtaining the seismic risk. The results are expressed in terms of the mean annual rate of exceedance of the base shear demand (<em>V</em><sub><em>b</em>,<em>d</em></sub>),&nbsp;&lambda;EDP,EDP, for the considered tanks at the selected site.

A parametric study, to evaluate the variation of important response quantities with change in the important system parameter, such as isolation time period, is also carried out. It is observed that equivalent acceleration pulses are quite effective to model the peak response of base-isolated liquid storage tanks under near-fault earthquakes. Nevertheless, the post-peak response time history may not be well captured by the equivalent acceleration pulses, specifically for broad tanks.

Placing a low permeable barrier beneath the landfill is a cost-effective approach to protect the subsurface environment. Recently local soil and/or waste materials (fly ash and flushed silt) amended with clay have emerged as an effective barrier to restrict and delay the leachate migration to the subsurface environment. One of the most critical selection criteria for landfill liners is hydraulic conductivity (Ks&le;10&minus;7&thinsp;&thinsp;cm/s), which often varies during the field construction of the liners owing to nonuniform compaction efforts. Failure to achieve the desired compaction leads to the random distribution of hydraulic conductivity within the liner. The movement of contaminants through a landfill liner becomes more complex due to the random variations in the hydraulic conductivity within the liner. To address this, a probabilistic analysis has been conducted to investigate the movement of contaminants in the landfill liner, considering the stochastic hydraulic conductivity scenario. Stochastic hydraulic conductivity realizations of four different composites (bentonite amended sand, flushed silt, fly ash, and locally available natural soil) were generated by varying the standard deviation (�) of lognormal distribution in hydraulic conductivity and horizontal (X) and vertical (Z) correlation lengths. The performance of the landfill liner is evaluated by conducting a series of numerical experiments in HYDRUS 2D/3D in terms of breakthrough time, peak concentration, and solute mass distribution in the liner.&nbsp;�&nbsp;is identified in an inverse correlation with the breakthrough time, and a value between 0.25 and 0.75 should be maintained to achieve a breakthrough&nbsp;time&gt;30&thinsp;&thinsp;years. The ratio of&nbsp;X/Z&nbsp;majorly governed the performance of the liner, and it is concluded that a higher ratio leads to better service life. At least a value of&nbsp;X/Z=5&nbsp;must be maintained while ensuring that X should not be less than 2. A smaller value of Z would be favorable for both peak concentrations and the breakthrough time. Amongst all composites and all stochastic combinations, natural soil amended with 30% bentonite outperforms with a delayed breakthrough time and lower peak concentrations.</p>\r\n', '', 'All of Above', '1', '1');

Results show that the trends in the drought indices have very high heterogeneity across different seasons. Overall, 13% (14%) grids show drying (wetting) trends for annual SPEI time series analysis. However, seasonally, it is found that monsoon and post- monsoon seasons have larger areas in the basin with wetting trends. Moreover, the pre-monsoon season has a larger area with drying trends.

This data has huge application in the precision agriculture, optimised irrigation, soil moisture monitoring and fertilizer application etc. However, the optimal number of sensors and the associated error curtailment is of great significance but cumbersome. Therefore, this study proposes a benchmarking approach to identify the optimum number of sensors required for field scale operations based on feedback from sensor performance under varying range of working conditions such as saturation percentage, salinity and temperature. The experiments were conducted in controlled temperature conditions varying from 2 to 45˚C. The sensor arrays from minimum of three to nine were grouped to collect moisture, salinity and temperature data and associated error. Overlaying the full-scale error band and 95% confidence interval produced by the sensitivity analysis used in determining the outliers.

As per the studies, India is highly vulnerable to droughts, occurring once in every three years from the past three decades. India receives 70-80% of its annual mean precipitation brought by south-west summer monsoon. Monsoon failure leads to the acute deficiency of available water that ultimately causes droughts and water scarce conditions. This study is an attempt to analyse the spatio-temporal variations of meteorological drought and to investigate the effect of topographical variable (elevation) on Indian summer monsoon drought characteristics over Indus River Basin. Indian extent of Indus River basin has been considered as a case. Heterogeneity of the elevation spread over the basin makes it suitable for the study. Therefore, to serve the purpose, daily gridded precipitation and temperature data at a spatial resolution of 0.12<sup>0</sup>&nbsp;x 0.12<sup>0</sup>&nbsp;for a time period of 42 years (1979-2020) is utilized to analyse the drought characterization. Modified Mann-Kendall method and Sen&rsquo;s slope estimator have been used to detect significant trends in the study region. Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) has been employed to identify the dry events on the basis of climatic water-balance. Indian summer monsoon lasts for four months (June-September), thus SPEI-4 has been computed to characterize the summer monsoon droughts. Results revealed that around 18% (5%) of the stations shows wetting (drying) trends for the monsoon time series analysis. Additionally, in relation to SPEI trends, larger area (25%) of the basin depicts increasing precipitation and decreasing Potential Evapotranspiration (PET) trends. Moreover, the study region experiences 1-10% and 1-5% severe and extreme drought frequency (percentage) respectively over the time period 1979-2020. Further, the relationship of SPEI trend with respect to elevation is explored because highlands are more vulnerable to climate change as compared to low altitude regions. In case of altitude up-to 2000 m, Sen&rsquo;s slope exhibits positive magnitude thus, wetting trend is observed. A very minimalistic drying trend is seen between 2000-3000 m elevation and beyond that almost no trend pattern is followed. The possible causes of this certain behaviour of SPEI trend with elevation is determined by further analysis of trend of meteorological parameters (precipitation and PET) that were used to calculate SPEI.

Further the random combination method has an inherent advantage of requiring very minimal input information whereas, the statistical and stratified sampling strategy requires data that has to be independent and normally distributed. The geostatistical methods requires a semi variogram model to get the necessary results.

The placement of a low permeable barrier at the bottom of the landfill would protect the soil and groundwater by restricting or delaying the leachate migration to the subsurface environment. Clay liners have traditionally been widely used to construct engineered barrier systems. The use of composite materials, particularly waste materials modified with clay, as landfill liners has increased in recent years. This study investigated the use of natural soil from the lower Himalayan region and fly ash, a waste product from thermal power plants, as a potential landfill liner material. The most important parameters in landfill design, hydraulic conductivity (&lt; 10-7 cm/s) and unconfined compressive strength (0.20 MPa), have been evaluated. Further, a set of contaminant transport experiments with reactive tracer were carried out for the composites to understand the governing transport mechanisms of leachate through a liner. The experimental data obtained was analyzed using the breakthrough curves. Different physical and chemical equilibrium and non-equilibrium transport models were employed to analyze the experimental data. The descriptive analysis of the BTCs suggests the contribution of multiple porosity domains in the transport of the contaminant through a liner. Factors like clay dispersion, swelling in clay, and immobile fractions behaving as source/sink terms contribute to complex transport behavior through the composite.

The traditional advection-dispersion equation (ADE) model is the simplest lumped model founded on the assumptions of Fick&rsquo;s law of diffusion. But it typically underestimates the breakthrough concentration in leading and/or tailing region due to non-fickian transport. It is modified into mobile-immobile model (MIM) considering the medium having micropores with stagnant water pockets but allowing solute exchange by diffusion between mobile and immobile zone which is quantified by mass transfer coefficient. Multi-process non-equilibrium (MPNE) model further simulates for a system with both physical and chemical nonequilibrium by assuming instantaneous and rate-limited sorption in advective and non-advective domains. Using the concept of dual permeability, slow fast transport (SFT) model divides the liquid phase in the domain into three zones i.e. fast, slow and immobile. Here chemical interaction between the fluid and soil matrix takes place only in slow and immobile zones. Non-fickian solute transport does not follow Brownian motion rules so a random variable is required to explain it. Hence continuous time random walk (CTRW) model is used where solute transport is characterized by joint probability variable.

For a time-dependent solute source, BTCs consists of two parts, for example, rising and falling limbs. During the rising part, the concentration in the mobile region is higher and mass transfer occurs from the mobile to immobile region. However, during falling limb concentration in the immobile region have higher values, resulting in the reverse diffusive mass transfer process. This study focuses on overcoming the reported limitations of the mobile&ndash;immobile model (MIM) in the prediction of long tails of BTC during the falling limb. To achieve this objective, we propose an approach that is based on the dynamics of time resident concentration and its gradient between hydraulically coupled mobile and immobile regions. In this modified MIM, we estimated two distinct diffusive MTCs for rising and falling limbs (RFMT) of BTCs using a nonlinear least square optimization algorithm. Two experimental data sets available in the literature were simulated using a numerical solution of the proposed model and asymptotic time-dependent dispersion function. The estimated parameters supported the hypothesis that for pulse type input, liquid phase transport during the rising limb of BTCs is governed by advection and dispersion, whereas during the falling limb it is majorly diffusive dominated that can be represented by the new MTCs. Simulated results of RFMT are then compared with continuous-time random walk (CTRW) and constant mass transfer (CMT) approaches to compare the quality of the simulation. A better overall simulation of experimental BTCs was obtained using RFMT in comparison with other models.

The models based on dual domains do not embraces the effects of near grain boundary layer flow velocity. To fill the gap we presents one-dimensional semi-analytical solution for slow, fast transport (SFT) model for simulating sub-surface solute transport. This model accounts for both chemical and physical non-equilibrium conditions within the soil matrix. Advective phase closer to the soil grains will have lesser velocity due to boundary layer formation and is called slow region while region away from soil grains will have higher velocity called fast region. Both instantaneous and rate limited sorption are assumed at slow and immobile region to characterize chemical non-equilibrium. Semi-analytical solution of this model is derived into Laplace domain and finally inversion is carried out by robust and widely implemented De-Hoog numerical inversion algorithm. Generalized solutions are developed for both semi-infinite and finite domain with zero initial concentration of solute in the porous matrix. Present solution is validated using existing numerical solution for slow fast transport (SFT) model. Experimental BTC&#39;s available in literature are simulated using the current solution and comparison is made with existing models which lump advective regions. Analytical expressions of temporal moments are also derived for SFT model to compare effect of mass transfer and advective velocity of different regions. Sensitivity analysis is carried out to ascertain the effects of sorption parameters over solute evolution. It is observed that better simulation of solute phase concentration can be made using current solution developed. Also sensitivity analysis show that increasing value of sorption parameter, increases residence period of solute. This solution developed can be suitably applied to field conditions where much heterogeneity is present assuming triple porosity continua.</p>\r\n', '', 'All of Above', '1', '1'),

For the reliable estimation of the hydraulic parameters i.e. hydraulic conductivity (K<sub>s</sub>) and porosity (Ɵ<sub>s</sub>), experiments are conducted at lab scale but for field scale it&#39;s expensive, time consuming and not feasible. The alternative approach is to use empirical relation based on physical properties of the aquifer material as these empirical relation are well established and are used extensively for the estimation of in-situ hydraulic parameters. This study is conducted to highlight the uncertainties associated with various empirical relations for the estimation of hydraulic parameters of heterogeneous porous medium. While estimating the input parameters for these empirical relations, spatial variability in soil characteristics along with interpolation error, unsteadiness of flow and the instrument calibration errors impose varying degrees of uncertainty. Classical uncertainty methods such as zero order, first order and second order uncertainty were applied to empirical equations that were often used for estimating K<sub>s</sub>. The combination of uncertainty quantification methods with different empirical equations were compared for the variance and mean estimates to identify the model of less uncertainty along with reliable mean estimate of K<sub>s</sub>. Thus, the values of the hydraulic parameters obtained from the empirical equations were then compared with the experiments conducted on three mini aquifer systems i.e. glass beads, sand and soil. Further the applicability of various empirical equations was delineated with the experimental results for a particular mini aquifer system. It is concluded from results that the uncertainty estimated from second order was more as compared to the first order uncertainty method, however mean value of K<sub>s</sub>&nbsp;estimate was in closer range.</p>\r\n', '', 'All of Above', '1', '1'),

It is observed that the plume area is larger at 36 m (Z = 230 m) depth as compared to plume area at other depths due to the presence of sandstone layer around the dumping site at 36 m (Z = 230 m) depth.

Advection, mechanical dispersion, molecular diffusion, decay processes, and solute exchange with the solid phase majorly govern the solute transport through porous media. All these processes play an important role in plume spreading and dilution, therefore quantification of impact of these processes on solute transport is essential to ensure the optimal cleaning operations. Most challenging task is to accurately predict the arrival time and spatial patterns of contaminant plume in the subsurface environment. The difficulty in prediction increases with the heterogeneity and chemical properties of solute and porous media. When solute transport parameters are different at different spatial and temporal scale, then predicting the behavior of solute in porous media become difficult. One of the most challenging aspect of studying solute transport through heterogeneous porous media is ever-growing effect of scale with space/ time on the estimation of dispersion. Influence of distance/ time-dependent dispersion on solute transport is observed at various scales. Therefore, present study focuses on the development of solute transport model which incorporate time-dependent dispersion with physical partitioning of heterogeneous porous media. In this study, numerical solution of Mobile-immobile model (MIM) with time-dependent dispersion is presented to simulate experimental data of conservative solute transport through a heterogeneous saturated soil column. Crank-Nicolson finite difference numerical technique is used to solve the coupled solute transport equations. Simulation capabilities of constant and time-dependent dispersion models are compared using time scale breakthrough curves for various down-gradient distances from input source. It is observed that the perturbation of solute concentration can be better simulated using MIM with time-dependent dispersion in comparison to constant dispersion model. Influence of time-dependent dispersion parameters on breakthrough curve is discussed. Numerical results depicted the early initial breakthrough point with decreasing time-dependent dispersion coefficient. It is concluded that timedependent dispersion function reduces the inherent uncertainty in estimation of coupling factor (mass transfer coefficient) in mobile-immobile model.</p>\r\n', '', 'All of Above', '1', '1'),

The performance of micropile is highly influenced by multiple parameters, with limited studies attempting to understand their individual contribution. With this in view, the current research work elucidates the multiparameter experimental study in a test pit filled with sand, hosting bored, and grouted micropiles. The factors considered in this study comprise pile embedment ratio (<em>L/D</em>), diameter (<em>D</em>), relative density of soil, grouting pressure, grout flow rate, and grout material with different levels. Taguchi method has been adopted to plan the experimentation. Statistical methods of Analysis of Mean (ANOM) and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) have been adopted to obtain optimum levels and percentage contribution of each factor. To achieve the optimum performance of the micropile, the analysis was intended to maximize the ultimate uplift load and minimize the corresponding vertical displacement. The results depict the overall dominance of&nbsp;<em>L/D</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>D</em>&nbsp;on the uplift resistance of micropile, whereas other factors have been analyzed to dominate the displacement in the micropile. It has been concluded that the displacement for the given micropile can be controlled by altering the soil density or resorting to pressure grouting, while the higher uplift capacity can be achieved by changing the geometry of the micropile.</p>\r\n', '', 'All of Above', '1', '1'),

However, the design of such structures has often been neglected, resulting in inconsistent standards and technical specifications. Typically, utility bridges are constructed first, and service lines like power cables and pipelines are later pulled through them, which can be a tedious process. An alternative approach involves using deployable structures with cables already placed inside, allowing for easy deployment across hindrances, such as the stream. The tensegrity concept offers a lightweight, sturdy, and deployable bridge that can be used temporarily with unique benefits like modifiable stiffness and easy dismantling. Tensegrity structures consist of strings and struts that act as dedicated tension and compression members and are characterized by their self-stressed configurations. To achieve these configurations, the cables must be pre-tensioned, requiring a form-finding approach to find the member prestresses. This study develops a Genetic Algorithm (GA)-based form finding approach that identifies a tensegrity module that complies with tensegrity properties and satisfies structural and constructional requirements. The GA combines the identified self-stressed states to create a tensegrity module capable of withstanding external operational loads while being internally stable. The resulting tensegrity bridge is compared against traditional utility bridges, highlighting its potential benefits and real-life applicability. The study concludes that a tensegrity concept is an efficient approach for utility bridge design.</p>\r\n', '', 'On My Page', '1', '1'),

If laboratory studies are to be meaningful in the context of in-situ problems, both the initial state and subsequent loading path in-situ have to be appropriately simulated in the laboratory. This is critical since most natural soils have an anisotropic (or technically a transversely isotropic) fabric and their response is direction dependent. The term initial state encompasses the density, fabric of the soil, and the stress conditions which are characterized by the three principal stresses and their directions. This paper summarizes the impact of anisotropic fabric on both monotonic and cyclic undrained behaviour of sands. The anisotropic response that is manifested in simpler triaxial compression and extension tests and is systematically studied using a relatively complex hollow cylinder torsional shear device. It is shown that the tendency for strain softening, which could lead to catastrophic consequences under monotonic loading, is very much dependent of fabric and loading path. It is demonstrated that current cyclic liquefaction design practice that depends on the cyclic resistance ratio, CRR is rather simplistic, but the available data suggests that cyclic simple shear resistance is possibly a lower bound for the actual resistance.

Several studies have been carried out in the past using these devices to identify the factors influencing the liquefaction characteristics of soil. The major objective in these studies is to characterize the dynamic behavior of soil due to the action of vertically propagating shear waves generated during an earthquake. This propagation of pure shear waves is based on the assumption that the soil strata are perfectly horizontal and homogenous.

To calibrate the parameters in each model, we divided the collected data into a training dataset (first 62 weeks) and a test dataset (last 16 weeks). Performance analysis of the models utilized Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and R-squared values.

Out of 23 parameters, 11 top-ranked features are selected for developing data-driven algorithms, including multiple regression, random forest, instance-based learner, an optimized version of support vector regression named sequential minimal optimization regression (SMOreg), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and an ensemble of MLP and SMOreg (MLP-SMO). These algorithms used the top-ranked geotechnical parameters and predicted the subsidence velocities. Results suggested that the MLP-SMO algorithm provided the best fit for data in 10-fold cross-validation with 0.94 RMSE. The MLP was the second-best model with 1.6 RMSE.

Furthermore, the ensemble of principal component analysis (PCA) and LSTM (PCA-LSTM) model was developed to reduce the dimension by PCA. The DR-A-LSTM model was compared with the simple LSTM and PCA-LSTM models to predict landslide movements. The data was split in the 80:20 ratio to train and test the ML models. The simple LSTM model produced 82.3% accuracy in the training data and 71.8% in the testing data. The simple LSTM model showed overfitting in the training data.

Mitigation of the potential negative effects of landslides commonly involves deployment of challenging and costly measures. This is often the case in the development and operation of linear infrastructures such as road, pipeline and railway networks in landslide-prone areas. One of the commonly employed measures for mitigating the adverse consequences involves monitoring of landslide triggering parameters and issuing timely warnings. Given that the landslide triggering parameters (e.g. large weather systems, local man-made triggers) and the linear infrastructures span varying spatial scales, there is a need for developing a landslide monitoring and early warning system for both regional and local scales. This paper presents a brief introduction of the Norwegian practice for early warning of landslides triggered by extreme weather on regional scale, which has proven to be effective. The criteria for issuing an early warning are based on the degree of saturation of soil and the supply of water to it through rainfall and snow melting. On other hand, monitoring of single slopes on local scales can be quite challenging and expensive. In order to provide landslide monitoring systems of single slopes in affordable price, Indian Institute of Technology Mandi developed a low-cost landslide monitoring and early warning system. These systems are deployed in Mandi district of Himachal Pradesh, India, and monitoring fifteen plus landslide locations.

One of the most sustainable biological methods to improve the engineering property of soil is Microbial-Induced Calcite Precipitation (MICP). MICP is the process in which the urease-producing bacteria in the presence of cementing solution deposits calcite in the soil voids thereby enhancing the in situ soil shear strength mainly by binding the particles together. For efficient bio-cementation, not only the amount of calcium carbonate but also its precipitation pattern is one of the major influencing factors. Earlier studies have depicted the pattern of calcium carbonate deposition for soil saturated with bacteria and cementing solution; however, the gap exists to understand the efficiency in relation to the percolated flow of bacteria and cementing solution. Keeping this in view, the current study is focused on understanding the precipitation pattern of calcium carbonate induced by&nbsp;<em>Sporosarcina pasteurii</em>&nbsp;(NCIM 2477) and cementing solution. This is achieved by sand column experiment with percolation method under different concentrations of cementing solution in unsaturated soil conditions and SEM-EDAX image analysis of the specimen derived from sand columns. Our results suggest that the concentration of cementing solution affects the precipitation pattern. We conclude that the sand columns percolated with S pasteurii cells followed by addition of multiple doses of low concentration of cementing solutions at defined time intervals resulted in the homogeneous pattern of calcite precipitation.</p>\r\n', '', 'All of Above', '1', '1'),

Desiccation cracking is one of such issues which results in variation of permeability, strength, and creation of zones of weakness. The cracks develop an irregular and/or preferential flow pattern for contaminant transport, thereby affecting the functionality of containment structures, such as for nuclear waste and hazardous wastes. Earlier studies depicted that, cracking characteristics of fine grained soils are mainly influenced by environmental conditions, soil type (mineralogy), evaporation rate, thickness of soil, and suggested various methods to arrest cracking using surfactants and controlling the evaporation rate in the soils. In lieu of the situation, where the cracks initiate due to poor tensile strength and high suction values, the above techniques may not be any more valid. In such situation, various other methods such as arresting plasticity, increasing the tensile strength of the soil by fiber reinforcement has been found effective. To demonstrate this, investigations were conducted in this study on soil specimen subjected to drying and thereby cracking. The present study counters the cracking by adding cement with the addition of sand and fiber. The cracking index of the soil is characterized by the parameter crack intensity factor (CIF), computed resorting to image analysis. Based on the present study, it has been observed that the least crack intensity factor have been succeeded for fiber-reinforced cemented compared to fiber-reinforced un-cemented soil.</p>\r\n', '', 'All of Above', '1', '1'),

Owing to the existence of variability in sample representation, selection of distribution and estimation of distribution parameters, the estimation of flood quantile has been always uncertain. Hence, suitable approaches must be developed to quantify the uncertainty in the form of prediction interval as an alternate to deterministic approach. The developed framework in the present study to include uncertainty in the FFA discusses a multi-objective optimization approach to construct the prediction interval using ensemble of flood quantile. Through this approach, an optimal variability of distribution parameters is identified to carry out FFA. To demonstrate the proposed approach, annual maximum flow data from two gauge stations (Bow river at Calgary and Banff, Canada) are used. The major focus of the present study was to evaluate the changes in magnitude of flood quantiles due to the recent extreme flood event occurred during the year 2013. In addition, the efficacy of the proposed method was further verified using standard bootstrap based sampling approaches and found that the proposed method is reliable in modeling extreme floods as compared to the bootstrap methods.</p>\r\n', '', 'All of Above', '1', '1'),

Though various mechanisms take place during the removal process, adsorption and uptake mechanism effectively emphasize the removal of MNPs and nitrogen and phosphorus in CW. The MNPs characteristics (type, size, and concentration) play a crucial role in the removal efficiency of nano-plastics (NPs) and micro-plastics (MPs). The enhanced removal efficiency of NPs compared to MPs can be attributed to their smaller size, resulting in a faster reaction rate. However, NPs dose variation showed fluctuating removal efficiency, whereas MPs dose increment reduces removal efficiency. MP and NPs dose variation also affected toxicity to plants and earthworms as observed from data. Understanding the fate and removal of microplastics in wetland systems will help determine the reuse potential of wastewater and restrict the release of microplastics.

Approximately 70% of the residential and heritage buildings in the region are made of unreinforced masonry constructed using locally available materials such as mud bricks, stones and timber composites. The region is seismically active and has already witnessed strong earthquakes causing huge loss of lives and livelihoods. Hence understanding the seismic performance of unreinforced masonry structures is important to ascertain the safety of these structures in the event of a future earthquake. With the ultimate aim to co-produce methodologies to evaluate and improve the seismic safety of lives and livelihoods in the region, this study presents the results of an extensive survey of domestic and heritage unreinforced masonry structures. One of the common structural typologies in the region is the Kath-kuni architecture of Himachal Pradesh; also called Tower Temples. Stonemasonry serves as a main load-bearing stratum and the geometric form of these structures is symmetrical which makes them less vulnerable to earthquakes. However, non-uniform mass distribution was observed along with the height of the structures, i.e., having higher mass lumped at a greater height, which reduces the ability of the upper portion of the structures to withstand the lateral force during an earthquake. Age-related deterioration of structural members was observed in some of the structures due to the lack of regular maintenance. This study concludes by suggesting options that could safeguard these structures in the event of future earthquakes.</p>\r\n', '', 'All of Above', '1', '1'),

The system was modified to accommodate an additional tensiometer to measure suction at the top besides the existing one at the bottom of the soil specimen. Soil specimens were subjected to drying and wetting following two procedures: discrete measurements carried out in stages to ensure equalisation and continuous measurement at different rates. All suctions measured during continuous and discrete measurements were very close at high saturation degrees. At lower saturation degrees, the suction values from the top and bottom of the specimen deviated from suctions observed in discrete measurements.

In this regard, a truncated spherical harmonic function, restricted up to second-order terms, is often used to define the fabric tensor; however, this constrains the generic description of material anisotropy. While getting deposited under gravity, granular solids often exhibit a cross-anisotropic fabric structure with a preferential particle contact orientation favored by the direction of deposition. In the present study, the stiffness tensor of a cross-anisotropic fabric structure has been explored taking into account both the second and fourth order truncation of the spherical harmonic function.

A numerical framework can be adopted to solve the field equations associated with the debris flow phenomenon in conjunction with a suitable material model mimicking the constitutive behaviour of the flowing mass. The front velocity and debris runout length are better predicted when the momentum balance equation takes into account the flow resistance due to turbulence, which inherently results in a nonhomogeneous distribution of the flow viscosity.

To calibrate the parameters in each model, we divided the collected data into a training dataset (first 62 weeks) and a test dataset (last 16 weeks). Performance analysis of the models utilized Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and R-squared values.

The PBS helps decrease the uncertainties related to hazard estimation compared to ground motion prediction equations. The PBS methods have a specific frequency threshold limit resulting from high computational demand. Hence, hybrid methods are required to attain broadband spectra for the simulated ground motion. This study uses a new artificial neural network (ANN)-based model to generate broadband ground motion spectra using the low-frequency spectral acceleration from PBS, source, path, and site parameters as input variables. A detailed parametric study and performance evaluation was made to identify the optimal input parameters in conjunction with the best-suited ANN architecture.

The seismic risk in the region is attributed due to the proximity to seismically active Himalayan faults, the possible seismic wave amplification due to huge sedimentary layers, and the vulnerability due to urban agglomerations. However, the region lacks a dense set of recorded data curbing the direct assessment of ground motion intensities. Hence, seismic hazard needs to be estimated based on synthetic ground motions for possible scenario earthquakes.

The characterization utilizes 100 tsunamigenic and 130 non-tsunamigenic slip models available in the SRCMOD database.

Then, it compares the estimated CDFs with nine standard distribution functions based on model fitting criteria like Akaike Information Criterion, mean squared error, correlation coefficient, and QQ plots. The analysis showed that the majority of slip distributions follow generalized Pareto or truncated exponential distribution functions. For the parameters of CDF estimated from slip fields, an empirical relation is proposed as a function of magnitude (Mw) to predict the corresponding values. As the next step, to understand the correlation structure of the slip field, semi-variograms are estimated along strike and along downdip for all rupture models considered in the study. A total of nine theoretical variogram models is compared with the semi-variogram of each slip field. From the analysis based on model fitting criteria, most of the slip field is observed to follow a stable variogram model. An empirical equation is developed to predict the sill and range of stable variogram function for a given Mw. Then, an iterative method based on translational field theory is proposed to obtain an ensemble of non-Gaussian slip fields for a given Mw and type of source. The generated sample fields from the proposed method match with the prescribed non-Gaussian distribution and variogram structure. In the sequel, the method estimates the variogram and the corresponding spectral density of the underlying Gaussian field according to translation field theory.

Estimating seismic wave amplifications is difficult in case of limited instrumentation, thus motivating us to propose a new simulation-based approach. The input required for the finite-element model include the spatial coordinates and the material properties (density, P-wave and S-wave velocities, Q factor) of the basin. Recent studies in the basin demarcate sediment layers of varying thickness, reaching down to a depth of 6 km and S-wave velocities ranging from 0.4-2.4 km/s (Srinivas et al., 2013). In the present study, our regional model has dimensions 900 x 900 x 80 km in x, y and z directions, discretized into 320 x 320 x 53 hexahedral elements. The top 6 km of the IG basin is divided into 8 different sediment layers with varying material properties. We use kinematic rupture models for the earthquake sources to simulate past as well as hypothetical future events. Two past earthquakes (Mw4.9, Delhi; Mw5.2, Chamoli) and two hypothetical earthquakes (Mw7.1; Mw8.5) are considered in our study. The rupture plane dimensions (L and W) and the slip distribution are estimated using the method of Mai and Beroza (2002). Based on focal-mechanism solutions and the depths of seismicity, we define the strike (580, 3090), the dip (650, 210), the rake (160, 770), and the depth of top edge of fault (5 km, 19 km) for the two large hypothetical earthquakes. Based on these parameters, the Centroid Moment Tensor (CMT) solution of the source is obtained. Ground motions are then simulated by solving the three-dimensional wave equation using the spectral element method (Komatitsch and Tromp, 1999). The key observations from our results are: 1) basin amplification factors for Peak Ground Velocity (PGV) are twice as high as Peak Ground Displacement (PGD) 2) PGV amplifications are as high as a factor of 6 for earthquakes occurring inside the basin, and a factor of 4 for Himalayan earthquakes (to the north of the study region) 3) The simulated shake maps of PGV and PGD show directivity.

The experimental data indicates strong influence of microfabric on the stress-strain relationship, shear strength, excess pore pressure evolution and volumetric response. This study shows that the microfabric can change the basic nature of clay.

Such spatio-temporal variations can although be estimated alongside, yet at the cost of making the estimable system dimension disproportionately large. Such augmented system dimension can thereby jeopardize tracking of the system evolution, either due to computational constraints or due to insufficient measurement channels (ill-posedness). This paper proposes a localized estimation approach wherein only a subdomain of the entire system is considered which reduces the dimension of the estimated model within manageable limits. To focus on the subdomain properties without knowledge of the rest of the model parameterization, a robust algorithm is developed through output injection using a simpler and sub-optimal version of Kitanidis filtering approach to induce robustness in the system parameter estimation against the boundary measurements. Finally, the subdomain model is estimated employing a marginalized filtering approach wherein a particle filter is employed for estimating both the eigenstructure and the controlling parameter while an ensemble Kalman filter estimates the states. The approach is demonstrated with the help of a mechanical system under spatial variation in temperature for which subdomain isolation necessitates the interface to be measured. In the context of the numerical application, the induced fault is due to damage, and the mechanical model is controlled and parameterized by the internal temperature, whose variations can be significant due to substantial external thermal variations inducing significant variations in the dynamic properties.</p>\r\n', '', 'All of Above', '1', '1'),

Eventually, this renders the structural joints to be characteristically weaker and more vulnerable than the members. Yet, damage detection research mostly assumes damage in the members only. This article proposes a model-based predictor&ndash;corrector algorithm that uses an interacting filtering approach to efficiently estimate joint damage in the presence of input and measurement uncertainties. For the predictor model, a novel strain-displacement relationship specific to semi-rigid frames is developed to map nodal displacements to corresponding strain measurements. The proposed estimation method embeds robustness against non-stationary input (e.g., seismic excitation) in the state filter, itself. For this, an output injection technique is integrated within the state filter. The modified state filter (robust Kalman filter) runs within an enveloping parameter filter (particle filter) to simultaneously estimate the system states and joint damage parameters, respectively, using the response signal. Strain has been adopted as measurement since it is frame independent (beneficial for seismic activity) and also comparatively cheaper to use. Numerical studies are performed on a two-dimensional (2-D) three-story three-bay shear frame for different joint damage locations and severities. The sensitivity and the stability of the proposed approach are further investigated.

The compression members float inside the network of tension members. Tensegrities are characterized by the presence of at least one infinitesimal mechanism, which is stabilized by the pre-stress present in the members, to ensure the equilibrium of the structure. Under external load, tensegrity may change its form by altering its member pre-stress, thereby affecting its global stiffness even in the absence of damage. Moreover, tensegrities can have different stiffness properties under the same structural configuration in the absence of any damage or external load, if the pre-stress levels of the members are different. However, the changes in dynamic characteristics of tensegrities are not limited to the aforementioned causes only and is also affected by ambient uncertainties. A variation in temperature may alter the dynamic characteristics of a tensegrity by influencing its material (Young&#39;s modulus, etc.) and structural (boundary conditions, structural dimensions, etc.) properties. This can potentially lead to a false impression of tensegrity damage/health. Meanwhile, the prolonged usage of tensegrity may lead to loss of pre-stress in the cables, buckling of the bars, corrosion, and damage of the members, etc. Thus affecting the structural stiffness which leads to change in the measured dynamic properties of the tensegrity.

The mean flow discharge for each month (i.e. January to December), seasonal variation (i.e. Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter) as well as an annual mean, annual maximum and minimum flows were analysed for each station. The results show that three stations (i.e. Ashti, Tekra, and Polavaram) demonstrate an increasing trend, notably during Winter and Spring.

Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), Standardized effective Precipitation Evapo-Transpiration Index (SP*ETI) and Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) at the timescale of 12-months have been used for drought characterization. The K-means clustering algorithm has been utilized to delineate distinct drought homogeneous regions in India. Trends and periodicities in drought characteristics have also been analysed. The results of this study reveal that increase in evapotranspiration due to projected rise in temperature would play a major role in affecting future drought dynamics in most parts of India. Analysis indicates that computed magnitude of drought intensity, duration and frequency depends on the choice of drought indicator. SPEI drought index has been found to project highest drought risk as compared to other two indices used in this study. North India is more vulnerable to increase in drought severity and frequency in near future. However in far future, most parts of the country, except few southeastern states, are likely to face an escalation in drought severity and frequency. A shift in drought hazard from central India toward southeast-central India is likely to happen with increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) concentration. The areal extent of droughts has been found to be increasing historically which is expected to increase further in future for most parts of the country. Historically, drought dynamics were more influenced by decrease in precipitation. However, in future, the drought dynamics will be significantly influenced by increased evapotranspiration resulting from increase in temperature in spite of likely increase in precipitation.

Many studies found that the frequency and intensity of individual events of floods and drought are increasing in recent decades due to climate change. However, it is still unclear whether the frequency of combined flood-drought events is increasing in the same year or not under the climate change scenario. To identify drought and flood characteristics, we used the Standardized Weighted Average of Precipitation (SWAP), and copula bivariate distribution concept to estimate the joint probabilities of combined flood-drought events of the same year. We utilized gridded rainfall data from the India Meteorological Department at 0.25 degree for the present study. We estimated drought, flood and combined flood-drought events for the base period (1901-1930) and the current period (1991-2018). The analysis demonstrates that about 51.97% of the total grid points show an increasing monthly SWAP values trend in the summer monsoon season. However, in winter, only 15.55% of the total grid points show an increase in the trend of monthly SWAP values. The univariate flood and drought analysis revealed that 83.98%, 83.98% and 81.90% of total grids show a significant percentage change of drought at 5, 10 and 25-year return periods, respectively when the current period is compared with the base period.

In many parts of the world, drought events have been found to possess a link with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). A better understanding of this relationship may help us in improving the drought prediction models. However, for India, the nature of this relation largely remained unexplored. Therefore, to quantify the causal relationship between PDO and droughts in India, a Granger Causality test-based methodology has been explored.

Previously, a few studies have attempted to investigate the droughts characteristics using projected data obtained from different climate models over India. However, these studies failed to quantify the uncertainty in the drought projection over different river basins of India. In this study, we analyse the uncertainty in various drought characteristics for near future (NF; 2020-2049), and far future (FF; 2070-2099) and compared with the historical baseline period (1970-1999). Uncertainty of copula based joint return period (JRPs) over various periods in future were also studied. Existence of a very high uncertainty for different drought characteristics such as severity, duration and intensity were found for most of the river basins. Results of Joint Return Period analysis revealed a high probability of co-occurrence of T5 and T10 characteristics together in the same year for most of the basins. The frequency of occurrence of any two drought characteristics exceeding their respective T50 return values together in the same year were found to decrease significantly in future with respect to the historical period.

Data from 7 RCM models namely, CCCma-CanESM2, CERFACS-CNRM-CM5, GFDL-ESM2M, MOHC-HadGEM2, MIROC-MIROC5, MPI-ESM-LR and MPI-ESM-MR for RCP 4.5 scenario have been used to calculate 12 month SPI and SPEI values.

Mann-Kendall and Sen&#39;s slope test have been used to detect trends in drought severity, duration, peak, and interval between drought events. Results of this study reveal that SPI shows decreasing trends in drought severity, duration and peak with negative Sen&#39;s slope, however, the SPEI shows increasing trends of severity, duration and peak with a positive Sen&#39;s slope for almost all over India. The analysis reveals that projected percentage of drought affected area based on SPI in the first half of the 21st century is higher compared to those obtained using SPEI, however for the second half of the 21st century, the projected drought affected computed using SPEI is higher compared to the corresponding area obtained using SPI. Decrease in droughts severity, duration and peaks in SPI analysis could be attributed to projected increase in monsoon rainfall in Indian Subcontinent during second half of 21st century however, SPI was found incapable to account the increase in temperature thus neglecting the drying due to increased evapotranspiration whereas SPEI shows significant drying in Indian subcontinent on account of increasing trend in temperature observed in projected future RCM scenarios.</p>\r\n', '', 'All of Above', '1', '1'),

A few predictors model-based approaches deal with these uncertainties through complex numerical models running online, rendering the SHM approach to be computeintensive, slow, and sometimes not practical. Also, with model-based approaches, the imperative need for a precise understanding of the structure often poses a problem for not so well understood complex systems. The present study employs a data-based approach coupled with Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) to correlate recorded response time histories under varying temperature conditions to corresponding damage scenarios. EMD decomposes the response signal into a finite set of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). A two-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (2DCNN) is further trained to associate these IMFs to the respective damage cases. The use of IMFs in place of raw signals helps to reduce the impact of sensor noise while preserving the essential spatio-temporal information less-sensitive to thermal effects and thereby stands as a better damage-sensitive feature than the raw signal itself. The proposed algorithm is numerically tested on a single span bridge under varying temperature conditions for different damage severities.

This paper extends an existing interacting filtering algorithm to efficiently estimate structural damages while being robust to unknown non-stationary non-Gaussian input forcing. Furthermore, this approach is generalized beyond linear measurements to encompass the case of non-linear measurements such as strains. The joint estimation of state and parameters is performed by combining Ensemble Kalman filtering, for non-linear system state estimation, and Particle filtering to estimate changes in the structural parameters.

Assessing the effect of non-stationarity through uncertainty quantification is a potentially feasible approach for HFA. This paper proposed to incorporate the particle filter (PF) into HFA (here flood frequency analysis (FFA) was exemplified) (named PF-FFA) for quantifying prediction uncertainty in flood quantile estimates. The feasibility of the PF-FFA was verified through comparison with the conventional L-moment based FFA (LM-FFA) as well as the random sampling based FFA (RS-FFA) in terms of both accuracy and precision respectively using several selected evaluation indices. Furthermore, the comparison of the use of constant and varying shape parameter in the PF-FFA demonstrated that the use of constant shape parameter would deteriorate the performance in both accuracy and precision, especially for datasets showing a high-level degree of non-stationarity.

In standard Kalman filter, system dynamics is described through the dynamics of certain internal variable, termed as states, evolving over time as defined by an assumed process model, while a measurement model maps these states to measurements. In some parameter estimation problems, the system is replaced by a state space formulation of the dynamic model with parameters appended in the unobserved states and collectively observed through the response measurements. Filtering based parameter estimation problems are thus inherently nonlinear due to the required nonlinear mapping of parameters to the corresponding observations. Being a linear estimator, Kalman Filter (KF) cannot be employed for such nonlinear system estimation and alternative filtering algorithms (eg. Particle filter) are therefore generally used. However, being model based, these filters optimally estimate the parameters of a quasi-static model of the real dynamic system. Consequently, any time variation in the system dynamics may completely diverge the estimation yielding a false or infeasible solution. By decoupling the estimation of system states and parameters, and applying concurrent filtering strategy that attempts conditional estimation of states based on parameters and vice versa, time varying systems can be estimated. This article attempts to combine KF with Particle filter (PF) and apply them for estimation of states and system parameters respectively on a system with correlated noise in process and measurement. The idea is to nest a bank of linear KFs for state estimation within a PF environment that estimates the parameters. This facilitates employing relatively less expensive linear KF for linear state estimation problem while costly PF is employed only for parameter estimation. Additionally, the proposed algorithm also takes care of those systems for which system and measurement noises are not uncorrelated as it is commonly idealized in standard filtering algorithms. As an example, for mechanical systems under ambient vibration it happens when acceleration response is considered as measurement. Thus the process and measurement noise in these system descriptions are obviously correlated. For this, an improved description for the Kalman gain is developed. Further, to enhance the consistency of particle filtering based parameter estimation involving high dimensional parameter space, a new temporal evolution strategy for the particles is defined. This strategy aims at restricting the solution from diverging (up to the point of no return) because of an isolated event of infeasible estimation which is very much likely especially when dealing with high dimensional parameter space.</p>\r\n', '', 'All of Above', '1', '1'),

The objective of model updating is therefore to adjust the mathematical model so that it can predict the actual response with better accuracy. In this paper, control theory based Eigen Structure Assignment (ESA) technique is used to update the finite element model (FEM). ESA uses state feedback to update existing system matrices. One of the benefits of using feedback in a closed loop system is its ability to alter system&rsquo;s transient response. In order to alter transient response, the eigenstructure of the system must be changed, which is accomplished in ESA based model updating methods through feedback control. This simultaneous assignment of eigenvalue-vector pairs in FEM generated system matrix is done by using a controller or gain matrix. However, unlike general control technique which uses active forces to control the system, here feedback force is fictitious and control is achieved through virtual forces that update the system matrix to match system eigenstructure to the desired one. In this paper, we extend the ESA based model updating by adopting state space identification to match the eigenstructure of model state matrix to the eigenstructure of the identified state matrix. FEM of an Euler-Bernoulli type beam and a transmission tower have been used to validate this method. The systems have been identified using their response histories at selected degrees of freedom applying stochastic state space algorithm.

Block shear test method is quite popular among practicing engineers for determination of cohesion and friction-angle of rock to rock and concrete to rock interface. Generally, at the stage of preliminary design, a value of desired shear strength parameters can be taken from available literature. However, such values must be used with proper engineering judgement. In case of rock mass, structural features of geology plays a very crucial role in affecting its engineering behavior. Same rock type may have significantly different shear strength parameters depending upon site-specific geological characteristics. In this paper, the variation in rock to rock and concrete to rock shear strength parameters of rock mass consisting of primarily Granites is studied among three different geological variants namely, (a) Western part of Himalaya, (b) Garo- Khasi Hills of Meghalaya, and (c) Eastern Ghat Belt of Andhra Pradesh. The variation in shear strength, cohesion and friction angle is studied in terms of strength ratio, cohesion ratio, and friction angle ratio. These values are also compared with values for Granites available in literature. Site parameters supported with quantitative analysis of in-situ data indicate that highest shear strength is expected at Eastern Ghat Belt and least shear strength at Garo- Khasi Hills.</p>\r\n', '', 'All of Above', '1', '1'),

Since the direct use of design spectrum ordinates is a preferred option for the practicing engineers, modal combination rules play central role in the peak response estimation. Most of the available modal combination rules are however based on the assumption that nonstationarity affects the structural response alike at the modal and overall response levels. This study considers those situations where this assumption may cause significant errors in the peak response estimation, and preliminary models are proposed for the estimation of the extents to which nonstationarity affects the modal and total system responses, when the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/ground-acceleration\" title=\"Learn more about ground acceleration from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages\">ground acceleration</a>&nbsp;process is assumed to be a stationary process.

These overpressure fronts move at superseismic speeds near ground zero and cause ground motion. Hence, determination of air-blast induced ground displacement is the first essential step in design of underground protective structures in super-seismic zone. For simplified analysis, air-blast load is modelled as linearly decaying pressure with time and using one-dimensional elastic wave propagation model, free-field vertical displacement response of elastic half-space can be expressed as a closed-form solution. However, such a simplified solution seems to be of very little practical utility in addressing problems in geotechnical environment. Hence, a new closed-form solution is proposed for displacement time-history which accounts for linear-inelasticity, plastic wave propagation velocity, and geometric stress attenuation. A conceptual pseudo-static procedure which computes vertical displacement as a static problem at each time instant based on dynamic properties of geomaterials is utilized to achieve the proposed solution.

Deformability of rock mass shows significant spatial variation due to structural features such as joints, bedding planes, foliations etc. However, variation may or may not be significant depending upon the behaviour of discontinuities. Variability in deformability of rock-mass with space results from many known and unknown sources of uncertainties. Inherent variability can be modelled as a random field in terms of Mean and coefficient of variation (COV) of modulus. Based on in-situ experimental study of deformability of Granite, Sandstone, and Phyllite rockmass from three different geologies in India, the COV of deformability are evaluated along with the mean values for which the COVs are applicable. To measure the variation in values of modulus a simple procedure is proposed in the paper. Furthermore, based on trends observed for COV of modulus with scale, a model is proposed for COV in terms of scale of measurement.

Previous experimental and theoretical research efforts indicate that the constitutive behavior of geomaterials under blast loading depends upon strain rate, stress level, and interaction among the three phases (solid, liquid, and gases). In current state-of-the-art, various advanced constitutive models are available to model the stress&ndash;strain behavior of geomaterials under blast-loads. However, considering the cost of computation associated with such models, a functional form is discussed to model the loading and unloading branches of stress&ndash;strain curve of geomaterials subjected to blast load based on the&nbsp;three parameters: weight factor, initial modulus ratio, and strain recovery ratio. It is observed that the new functional form reasonably captures the mean trend of the experimentally obtained or simulated stress&ndash;strain data. This paper further investigates the applicability of this functional form and provides a catalog of the model parameters for direct use by practicing engineers. The dependence of function parameters on strain rate, lateral confinement, degree of saturation, initial compaction, and locking initiation stress is investigated, and some simple rules are proposed for reasonable estimation of the three parameters. The proposed functional form would be quite useful in practical design problems specially where cost of computation associated with advanced constitutive models is too high. In addition to this, the proposed simple parametrization of complex nonlinear stress&ndash;strain behavior also provides an opportunity to investigate the effect of uncertainties in soil parameters in a computationally efficient manner.</p>\r\n', '', 'All of Above', '1', '1'),

Such scenarios necessitate the utilization of available resources to the best possible extent, in carrying out sampling procedures required for evaluation of design parameters like shear strength (concrete over rock; rock over rock) and deformability characteristics of rock mass. In order to carry out these tests, it is mandatory to get enough upward reaction for the expected structural loads (which are usually of higher magnitude), for better engineering judgements. These loads will have to be compounded to the conservative side, by at least 1.5&ndash;2 times of the expected design loads.

Excavation of a tunnel in such a pre-stressed media causes deformation of tunnel cross-section. Ovalization of tunnels due to in-situ stresses in rock-mass is an important design parameter. For estimation of tunnel ovalization, state of in-situ stresses needs to be determined first. In-situ stresses determined through hydro-fracturing technique (HFT) are dependent upon the three HFT parameters: (a) shut-in pressure, (b) re-opening pressure, and (c) fracture orientation. A critical review of previous studies indicates that HFT parameters are subjected to uncertainties due to (1) limitations of testing procedures and equipment, (2) assumptions and subjective engineering judgment associated with interpretation of test results, and (3) inherent variability of geological formations. Therefore, tunnel deformation estimates based on in-situ&nbsp;stresses determined through HFT would also be affected by these uncertainties. In this paper, a framework based on the first-order second moment method is developed to evaluate the effects of uncertainties in hydro-fracturing test data on tunnel deformation. The analysis indicates that uncertainty in tunnel deformation depends upon the uncertainty levels as well as magnitude of the three HFT parameters along with Poisson&rsquo;s ratio, height of overburden, and the angular location of the point on the tunnel periphery where deformation is being estimated. It is also found that among the three parameters, the shut-in pressure has the maximum relative contribution in the resulting uncertainties in tunnel ovalization with an average of 68% (&plusmn;&thinsp;8% standard deviation). The proposed methodology is explained through an example case-study from Bukit Timah Granite rock-mass of Singapore. It is found that for a range of coefficient of variation of shut-in and re-opening pressure from 0 to 50%, the maximum coefficient of variation of tunnel deformation varies between 63 and 332%. In view of such high uncertainties, it is recommended that uncertainties of HFT parameters must be taken into account in the design procedure to avoid unsound engineering judgments.</p>\r\n', '', 'All of Above', '1', '1'),

The behaviour of geomaterials under blast loading depends upon strain rate, stress level and interaction among the three phases. A few advanced constitutive models are proposed in the literature to model stress-strain behavior. However, a less accurate but simple alternative is to use functional forms for capturing the experimental stress-strain curves. In this paper, the functional form of stress-strain curve of geomaterials subjected to air-blast (uniaxial high strain-rate loading) is proposed based on the deformation mechanism of geomaterials. The proposed model consists of two different expressions for loading and unloading and requires only three parameters. The physical meaning of the three model parameters is discussed and the procedure for their evaluation is outlined. It is found that the proposed functional form captures the experimental stress-strain curves very well.</p>\r\n', '', 'All of Above', '1', '1'),

With the advancements in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), it becomes critical to have a comparative study on the new methods of obtaining ground motion parameters for a region. Traditional GMPEs developed using parametric regression assume a fixed functional form, and in doing so, it becomes challenging to draw the complex and nonlinear characteristics of the data completely. Adopting nonparametric regression methods, which are independent of predefined equations, helps us to overcome these limitations. This paper investigates a comparative study of some common machine learning algorithms to forecast peak ground acceleration (PGA) associated with ground motion data of NGA West. The prediction model considers nonparametric types of regression and tries to manifest the advantages of these models over conventional GMPEs, derived using parametric regression. The present work explores algorithms like decision trees, random forests, support vector regression, and weighted average ensemble method (WAEM). Also, the performance of the developed models is compared with that of conventional methods. In this study, the earthquake magnitude, rupture distance, average shear wave velocity, and the type of faulting mechanism are used as predictor variables. The algorithms are trained using a database of 13,555 ground motions, with magnitude ranging from 3.0 to 7.9 recorded over the rupture distance range of 0&ndash;500&nbsp;km.

It is worth mentioning that soil properties contain a certain level of uncertainty that can influence the RC frame&rsquo;s response under the influence of SSI. The present work focuses on quantifying the effect of soil material uncertainty on the response of RC frame building. A planar mid-rise RC moment frame, designed as per Indian standard codes, has been considered and modelled in OpenSees. The numerical model of the frame along with soil is analyzed using the direct approach by considering the nonlinear behavior of both soil and structure.

Use of plastic products such as polythene bags, bottles etc. is increasing day by day leading to various environmental concerns. Therefore the disposal of the plastic wastes without causing any ecological hazards has become a real challenge. Thus using plastic bottles as a soil stabiliser is an economical utilization since there is scarcity of good quality soil for embankments. This project involves the detailed study on the possible use of waste plastic bottles for soil stabilisation. The analysis was done by conducting plate load tests on soil reinforced with layers of plastic bottles filled with sand and bottles cut to halves placed at middle and onethird positions of tank. The comparison of test results showed that cut bottles placed at middle position were the most efficient in increasing strength of soil. The optimum percentage of plastic strips in soil was found out by California Bearing Ratio Test and using this percentage of plastic, plate load test was also performed.

This growth in blade swept area, however, gives rise to heightened loads, stresses and deflections, imposing more rigorous demands on the structural robustness of these components. To prevent sudden failure and to plan effective inspection, maintenance, and repair activities, it is vital to estimate the reliability of the rotor blades by considering all the forces (aerodynamic and structural dynamics) acting on them over the turbine&#39;s lifespan. This research proposes a comprehensive methodology that seamlessly combines fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulation, Kriging model/algorithm and Adaptive Kriging Monte Carlo Simulation (AKMCS) to assess the reliability of the HAWT rotor blades. Firstly, high-fidelity FSI simulations are performed to investigate the dynamic response of the rotor blade under varying wind conditions. Recognizing the computationally intensive nature and time-consuming aspects of FSI simulations, a judicious approach involves harnessing an economical Kriging model as a surrogate. This surrogate model adeptly predicts blade deflection along its length, utilizing training and testing data derived from FSI simulations. Impressively, the Kriging model predicts blade deflection 400 times faster than the FSI simulations, showcasing its enhanced efficiency. The optimized surrogate model is then used to estimate the flap wise blade tip deflection for one million wind speed samples generated using Weibull distribution. Thereafter, to evaluate the reliability of the blades, statistical modeling using methods such as Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS), AKMCS is performed. The results demonstrate the faster convergence of AKMCS requiring only 21 samples, as opposed to 1 million samples for MCS with minimal reduction in the precision of the estimated probability of failure (Pf) and reliability index (&beta;). Demonstrated on the backdrop of an IEA-15MW offshore reference WT rotor blade, the proposed methodology underscores its potential to be seamlessly incorporated into the creation of WT digital twins, due to its near real-time predictive capabilities for Pf and &beta; assessments.</p>\r\n', '', 'All of Above', '1', '1'),

Structural fatigue estimation is however a complicated proposition since the entire structure needs to be monitored irrespective of the fatigue proneness of different parts of it. This eventually invites huge computational cost due to high dimensional modelling and also dense instrumentation for precise estimation of the fatigue related properties or parameters. It has been perceived that only a certain specific locations are fatigue prone and standalone fatigue monitoring of only that subdomain is possible provided the forces acting on to it is available. To isolate the subdomain of interest from the entire structural domain, one needs to compensate with boundary forces at the domain boundaries which is never possible to be measured. This study proposes a subdomain estimation based approach powered by interacting Ensemble-Particle filtering approach (IP-EnKF) that monitors only a subdomain of interest (fatigue prone) independently for its structural and damping properties while estimating the boundary forces in parallel for subsequent fatigue life estimation. This allows employment of computationally inexpensive predictor models for any model assisted health monitoring approach while reducing the required cost and effort of instrumentation.

These factors include meteorological, hydrological, and climatological processes that operate at different scales, including regional and global. In addition, these processes are often influenced by human activities such as land use and resource management, which can further increase the uncertainty of predictions.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\'Times New Roman\'\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">Given the complexity of the processes involved and the potential consequences of these extreme events, it is essential to develop improved prediction and management models that can provide more accurate and timely information about the likelihood and impacts of floods and droughts.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\'Times New Roman\'\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">One common approach for predicting hydroclimatological extremes is the use of coupled atmospheric-hydrological modelling, which involves simulating simulation of atmospheric processes such as temperature, pressure, and humidity along with the movement and behaviour of water on and below the surface. This can include the prediction of river flow, groundwater recharge, and the impacts of land use and resource management on water availability.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\'Times New Roman\'\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">By combining these traditional process-based modelling approaches with AI and deep learning techniques, it is possible to improve the accuracy and reliability of predictions about the occurrence and impacts of floods and droughts. This can ultimately help to better inform decision-making and risk management strategies, and reduce the negative impacts of these extreme events on communities and critical infrastructure.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<h3><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\'Times New Roman\'\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">&nbsp;</span></span></span><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\'Times New Roman\'\"><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>Research Objectives</strong></span></span></span></h3>\n\n<ol>\n	<li style=\"list-style-type:decimal\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\'Times New Roman\'\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">Development of reliable atmospheric model, hydrological model and hydrodynamic model parameterization for accurate simulations of hydroclimatic fluxes.</span></span></span></li>\n	<li style=\"list-style-type:decimal\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\'Times New Roman\'\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">To develop a robust hydrologic decision support system for predicting and managing extreme events using novel frameworks which use combinations of process based modelling and deep learning.</span></span></span></li>\n	<li style=\"list-style-type:decimal\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\'Times New Roman\'\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">To Analyse the long term impacts of climate change on local Himalayan communities and development of better adaptation strategies that better suit local conditions.</span></span></span></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\'Times New Roman\'\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>\n\n<h3><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\'Times New Roman\'\"><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>Methodology</strong></span></span></span></h3>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\'Times New Roman\'\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">Our methodological spectrum comprises numerical and stochastic simulations in combination with AI based models , in particular coupled models, to quantify the process interactions. An example is the coupling of weather forecasting models with catchment models and hydrodynamic models for simulating soil storage, snow storage and the water fluxes in rivers and inundation areas. Recently, explainable AI based models and deep learning based architecture have emerged as very powerful tools to help in generating predictions and classifications. Especially in hydroclimatological sciences, a number of studies have been published to showcase the utility of these tools. However, AI based models are solely dependent on data and don&#39;t consider physics into consideration. In our proposed framework we plan to use process based simulation in combination with AI based models to develop innovative approaches for identifying patterns in large data sets.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\'Times New Roman\'\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">&nbsp;</span></span></span><img height=\"255\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ej3QzAwh9MQODDoNBXrUZlyPzjvcNyMTPg0yJ-5EZB4fAjW43w6f0E0Lu8Aiw_FmL8TDMOIYij2ESMpygJNG6tDTO06gdRNJYh0Q4JALd9VOaxP7MagtLFM8Lx1IfXMZ6TpZm28K5exXIl4Q0LFJiSU\" width=\"226\" /></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\'Times New Roman\'\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">Examples are non-stationary extreme value statistics and non-linear methods such as Bayesian Networks or Random Forests.
